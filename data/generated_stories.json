      "title": "I’ve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won’t Stop Crying",
      "content": "Thirty hours ago I hopped on a late-night flight from New York heading to Los Angeles. After boarding I saw that I had an entire row to myself. Take off passed without incident, and soon I was stretched out for a nap across the row. I slept for a few hours, I don’t know how long, but I woke up to some severe turbulence. It’s possible that the lights in the cabin went out for a moment, but I was so disoriented that it’s hard to say. I checked my phone to see that it was 4:03 AM, which I figured gave me about an hour until we landed. When I looked out my window, I was shocked to see nothing but wide open ocean. My jaw dropped; there’s obviously no ocean between New York and Los Angeles. I hit the button to call the flight attendant and spent the next few minutes wracking my brain for a lake that could’ve been possibly been big enough to explain what I was seeing. I jumped when the attendant flipped off the light. She was grinning from ear to ear, and tears were pouring down her cheeks. “How can I help you sir?” she asked. I froze for a moment at her reaction before deciding to just ask my question. “Where are we? Why does it look like we’re flying over an ocean?” She wiped her cheeks to clear the tears, still grinning wildly. “Sir, we’ll be landing in about an hour.” “I, uh, OK, thank you,” I said. After she left I checked the clock on my phone again. 4:03 AM blinked back at me. It hadn’t changed. I had to have been waiting with my call light on for at least five minutes. How was it possible that it hadn’t changed at all? I opened up my laptop and saw it too displayed 4:03 AM. I pulled out my phone, started a stopwatch in the app, and spent the next two hours looking back and forth between the clocks, waiting for them to change. They never did. I tapped the shoulder of an older woman sitting in the row ahead of me. She looked back, an annoyed expression across her face. “Yes?” she asked. “Do you know how long until we land?” I asked. She narrowed her eyes. “That flight attendant said it would be about another hour.” I shook my head in confusion. “That flight attendant? We talked almost two hours ago! We should’ve landed already.” She stared at me as if I was crazy. I was going to continue trying to convince her, but I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun to see a male flight attendant grinning down at me, tears pinging off his cheeks onto my shoulder. “Sir, I’m going to ask you to calm down, or I’ll be calling the Captain.” I told him that wouldn’t be necessary and sat back. He removed his hand and stepped away. The flight attendants continued to stop by every few hours offering meals. My stopwatch continued to tick up and is now telling me that I’ve been on this plane for more than thirty hours. I’ve explored all of coach and tried talking to some of the other passengers, but they’ve all told me that they’re expecting to land in an hour or so. Around three hours ago I tried getting into first class. I made it past the curtain but was escorted back by two grinning flight attendants. Their grip on my arms were like iron. “Sir, the seatbelt sign is on,” one said. “Please remain in your seat with your buckle fastened. We’ll be landing in about an hour.” I’d just about given up hope when a woman came down the aisle dressed in a business suit. She didn’t look at me or slow down, but she dropped a piece of paper onto my tray as she made her way to the bathrooms at the back of the plane. I shot a look around before unrolling it. It said, “Are you stuck too?” I pulled out a pen and wrote “Yes. It’s been thirty hours.” I folded the scrap of paper up and set it on the tray closest to the aisle. She left the bathroom and picked it up as she passed. It’s been twenty minutes since then. I don’t know why, but I don’t think the flight attendants would like it if they knew we were talking. It doesn’t matter. I have to do something. I’ll update you all with whatever happens next. Part 2 More: /r/WorchesterStreet",

      "title": "The Monster Under your Bed isn't Always there to Scare You",
      "content": "I was lying alone in my room when I heard the voice, deep and crackly, coming from beneath my bed. “Hey,” the voice called out. I told myself I was just imagining it. “Hey kid,” the voice repeated. I drew my knees up to my chest and ducked my head under the blanket, trying to shut out the voice and the cold wind that drifted in through the window, ruffling the curtains. “Who are you?” I asked. “I’m the monster underneath your bed,” the voice replied. “You mean you’re real?” I asked. “What do you mean?” the monster said. “Of course I’m real.” “Do you have a name?” I asked. “Of course I have a name.” “Oh... well what is it?” “Frank.” “Frank?” “Yeah,” the monster said. “Is there something wrong with that?” “No. I mean, I don’t know,” I said. “It’s just not very monster-ly.” “Well my parents didn’t want me to be a monster.” “Really? What did they want you to be?” “A dentist.” “That’s funny,” I said. I could feel myself beginning to smile. “What do your parents want you to be?” it asked. “I don’t know... Hey Frank?” “Yeah?” “Aren’t you gonna... like... scare me or something?” “What? Why would I do that?” “Well, you’re a monster, aren’t you?” “Well, yeah, of course I am, but that doesn’t mean that I scare little kids.” “But I thought that was your job.” “It is my job to scare people,” he replied. “But only bad people.” “Am I a bad person?” I asked. “No,” he said, “but you’re not the one I’m here to scare.” “Who are you here to scare?” I asked. “The man inside your closet.” The skin on my arms goosefleshed up. I wanted to ask him what he meant, but I fell silent as I heard a rustling coming from the closet. The door creaked open, and I could hear soft footsteps padding towards me across the bedroom floor. I didn’t dare peek out of the blanket. The footsteps stopped, and I could hear heavy breathing next to me. I squeezed my eyes tight. The warm sanctuary of the blanket disappeared as it was yanked off me. I hugged my arms around my knees and prepared for the worst. A scream shattered the night air, followed by the sound of breaking glass. I opened my eyes a crack to see a knife lying on the carpet next to my bed, blade glinting in the moonlight. My parents rushed into the room and asked me what had happened, but I didn’t know what to say, only that someone had been hiding in my closet and they’d jumped out the window. My parents called 911, and the police came right away. They picked up a man called Gary Thompson sprinting through the streets a couple blocks away. He was covered in blood and broken glass. They found Gary’s car abandoned on our property, and inside they found duct tape, knives, barbiturates and a video camera. From what I heard Gary’s lawyer employed an insanity defense, and Gary is currently incarcerated in a state mental facility for the criminally insane. I never heard from Frank the monster again, but the officer who arrested Gary told me that he sleeps on the floor of the facility. He tells the doctors that he’s terrified of Frank, the monster under his bed. x",

      "title": "My Husband Brought Home a Fake Daughter",
      "content": "This is not my child. That was all I could think. “Honey?” said my husband. “Is everything all right?” “Who is this?” I said, staring at the little girl I’d never seen before, standing in my house, dressed in my daughter’s clothes. “Where is Liza?” My husband gave me a worried look, and the girl-who-was-not-Liza looked positively terrified. “What do you mean?” said my husband. “Are you feeling all right?” Why was he evading my question? Why couldn’t he just answer? I took a deep breath, tried to remain calm. “I’ll be all right,” I said, “as soon as you tell me where my daughter is.” My husband frowned, and the little girl’s eyes welled up with moisture. My husband placed a protective hand over her shoulder, and leaned down to whisper in her ear. “Go on upstairs, honey,” he said. “Mommy’s not feeling well.” The girl wasted no time in doing what he said. She clutched her schoolbooks to her chest and barreled past me, rushing up the stairs. I heard the door of my daughter’s room slam. The look on my husband’s face was a mix of pity and restrained anger. “You haven’t been taking your medication,” he said. “Don’t try to deny it, I can see it in your eyes.” I waved my hand in a dismissive gesture. “I don’t need them,” I said. “They make my mind all fuzzy.” The anger on my husband’s face became less restrained. Well-etched frown lines beneath his lips deepened. “Do you remember what happened the last time you said that?” he asked. “I...” The suggestion was enough. A swarm of shattered and confused images flooded my mind, like the wave of nausea that comes before vomit. My husband screaming, covered in blood. Look what you made me do! he was shrieking. Look what you made me do! I felt the floor tilt beneath me, and before I knew what had happened, I found myself falling backwards into my husbands arms. Hot tears were streaming down my cheeks, and my body convulsed with violent sobs. My husband gently brushed my hair and whispered in my ear. “Shhh,” he cooed. “It’s not real, honey. I promise that it’s not real.” I silently nodded my assent. I let him carry me up to our bedroom and lay me gently down on the bed. He walked over to the dresser where he kept the cocktail of drugs that I took every day to maintain my sanity. I swallowed them gratefully. Soon my mind was going fuzzy, I could feel myself becoming a pliable zombie that could be told anything, made to do anything. Of course I knew that it was wrong, that that girl was not Liza. I knew that it wasn’t me who had been driven insane by our daughter’s death, but my husband. I knew he had kidnapped that girl when she was a toddler, and brainwashed her into believing she was Liza. But, most importantly, I knew that if I didn’t take my pills, if I shattered his precariously built illusion, that he would kill the girl and start all over again. Just like he did the last time. x",

      "title": "My son asked me to check the closet for monsters. I didn't need to.",
      "content": "I recently went through a pretty nasty divorce, but I got the only thing that mattered out of it: full custody of my 4-year old son. Lost nearly everything else in the process so we had to relocate to a new house with barely any luggage or furniture. Truly a fresh new start. I heard him call for me during our first night at our new home. It was a little after midnight, I think. I went to check on him to see what was wrong and sat by his bedside. He was wide awake and asked me to check the closet for monsters, which wasn’t surprising given the circumstances. He’s still just a little kid, and without even taking into account all the crap he’s been put through thanks to my shitty marriage, moving into an unfamiliar, barely furnished home must be a lot to take in for someone his age. And you know how they say that your brain always stays half-awake when you’re sleeping in a new environment, right? That’s all pretty much what went through my mind in a flash as soon as my son spoke. It was no big deal. It was all normal, I thought. But something else almost immediately clicked inside my brain, before I even got to look at where my son had pointed to while he made his innocent request. Something was wrong. I turned my head and looked, and it took everything I had in me to not give in to fear and terror, all for the sake of my son. When you become a parent you have to protect your children no matter what, always putting yourself in harm’s way if necessary and spare them any and all kinds of things that might hurt them. That’s why I didn’t freak out. I couldn’t, not when we had barely just started our new life. I had to protect him, and at that point in time as I sat on his bed I only knew one thing: We had to leave the room. We had to leave the house immediately. “Alright champ, of course” I said, faking bravery. Then I made a request of my own as I lowered my voice and got closer to him: “Hey, how about you step outside for a minute? If there’s a monster in there, I’ll have to kick its BUTT all over your room!” He chuckled and said “okay”. I made sure to put some extra emphasis on the word “butt” because it’s something that always cracks him up when I say it. Fortunately he got stuck on that and not the fact that I was indirectly admitting to the possibility of there actually being a monster. As soon as he left the room my mind raced as it started to put together the best and most efficient route to take him out of the house while picking my car keys and phone on our way out. When I heard the closet doors slowly creaking open behind me I knew it was time to go. I jumped out of the bed, exited the room and grabbed my son. We were out of the door and inside the car and moving in under a minute. I told him I couldn’t sleep so we were going out for some ice-cream to celebrate. He was a little taken aback and asked “celebrate what”, to which I replied “just us two together, I love you buddy.” It was by no means a lie, but I just had to make sure that he was alright and wouldn’t think of anything else as we literally fled our new home. As I mentioned earlier, the house was a new environment for the two of us. I’d been there a couple of times before, cleaned it all up by myself and assembled what little furniture we had, so I knew for a fact what belonged where and what didn’t. And I know his room didn’t have a closet.",

      "content": "“I want you to kill her,” the voice echoed. Low, monotonic, unwavering. In front of me was my mother, crucified haphazardly upon a ramshackle wooden cross. Rivets were driven through each palm - with rope fastenings in place around her ankles and shoulders to keep her in position. Her eyes, red and cracked from exposure, pulled open by tape, to reveal pupils dilated with fear. Her mouth was sewn shut. Muffling her tired pleas. “This is hardly an existence,” the voice licked. I surveyed my surroundings. I was in a small, square room, with metal walls no larger than my studio apartment. The roof, however, was missing, replaced by an empty void that seemed to stretch endlessly into the darkness above. About five feet in front of me was my mother. Writhing weakly against her restraints. Five feet behind her, an impossibly tall ladder stretching into the abyss. “What are you waiting for? As if you care,” the voice prompted. Who was talking? Where was this voice coming from? Its warm presence swaddled me like a warm blanket. In one swift surge, the gravity of the situation dawned on me. I didn’t know where I was. I didn’t like being lost. I felt the kick of adrenaline into my bloodstream. My heart, beating against my ribcage. My hands, clammy. I clenched them repeatedly. Open, closed. Open, closed. I needed to get out of here. “End her.” My gaze dashed to my right hand side to find a surgical stand stocked full of pain-inflicting paraphernalia. A knife. A rope. A pistol. Razor blades, full needles, strange pills and powder. An arsenal fit to maim, disfigure, destroy. I reached for the razor blade. I could cut the stitching on my mother’s mouth - garner some insight into what the fuck was going on. My mother always knew what was going on. With the razor blade in hand, I walked gingerly up to my mother - whose eyes lit up as I approached. And through all the pain, tears and stitches, as I drew closer, she smiled. I held up my left hand to coddle my mother’s face, with the razor blade still pinched in my right. And as she nuzzled her face into my palm, I cracked. I wept harder than I’d ever wept before. Full-bodied, wracking sobs crashed over me. Because it didn’t matter how bad anything got. It didn’t matter how broken the situation, or how broken the person. My mother was just happy I was there. I steadied myself and lifted up my right hand, trembling as I drew closer to her face - ready to pick away at the stitches to the best of my ability. The first few snapped, then the next, until all the stitches had been split and I had liberated her mouth from its cage. I exhaled raggedly, leaning back to look deeply into my mother’s eyes. “M-Mum?” But as tears fell down her cheeks, through her warm, loving smile, she uttered one word. “Climb.” I peered past her towards the ladder, then looked back towards her for reassurance. It took a slow, simple nod to realise that this was what I had to do. And as I walked slowly towards the ladder, she murmured one last thing. “I love you.” “I love you too, mum.” I never said that enough. Then, with razor blade still in hand, I climbed. I climbed with determination. I climbed for what seemed like hours. I climbed past broken rungs, and even when I was tired, I kept on climbing. I cried as I climbed, but I pushed through, with snot dribbling down my chin and tears clouding my vision. I reminisced as I climbed. I climbed through good memories, I climbed through bad memories. I climbed through the time when I had the flu and my mother came around to do my laundry, and I climbed through the time my girlfriend cheated on me. I climbed because I was sick of this dark room. I climbed to make my mother proud. And as I climbed, the darkness subsided, opening itself up to light. I could see the where the ladder ended now. I could see my way out. As I placed my hand on the last rung of the ladder and pulled myself up over the edge, I was overcome by brightness. The light subsided, and as I got my bearings, I found myself on my back in my bathtub, still clutching the razorblade. Urgent knocking on my bathroom door roused me from my daze. “Are you alright in there? Your sister called. We’re worried about you.” It was my mother’s voice. I got up out of the bathtub, and placed the razorblade back on the shelf, walking towards the door. And as I flung it open, she looked at me. She looked at me and she knew. She held me in her arms and we sobbed. “I wouldn’t know how to live without you,” she whimpered. My climb had just begun.",

      "content": "“Huh?” I asked, pulling off one side of my headphones. “I said I like your boots,” the man repeated. “Oh, thank you.” “I had a bunch of pairs exactly like ‘em for years and years—a good workin boot, ya know?” “They definitely are, I use them every day on the job.” “Where’s that at?” “Turner Construction.” “Ah, yes, yes. You’re building that big ole’ thing up on East Avenue, ain’t ya?” “Yes, sir. It’s going to be one of the biggest in the city.” “So it seems. I used to do construction too, ya know? That was way back in the day. I started back when your mama was probably a toddler.” “Oh, yeah? With a company, or freelance, or…?” “My papa had a small construction and carpentry business. He hired me on when I was, oh, maybe 15 or so. That was all the way back in 1962! We built houses, mostly, a couple small apartment complexes—nothin as big as what you’re working on.” “Did you like it?” “Boy, you bet your ass I did. Workin all day was a free gym membership! Ha! Plus, all the perks that came with it.” “Perks?” He smiled. “Can ya keep a secret, boy?” “Yes, sir.” “You ever play in a construction site as a child? When I was a lil’ one, me and my buddies would sneak into houses being built and explore ‘em. Maybe break a couple bottles here and there.” “Yeah! My neighbors and I used to do that when I was a kid. My house was one of the first built in our neighborhood, then the rest came later. We probably explored every house on the block before they were finished—when they were just wood skeletons—maybe breaking a couple bottles too, to tell you the truth.” “Of course ya did. Who wouldn’t, given the opportunity? But that’s all the childish stuff. The real perks came later in life, when I was an adult.” “Oh?” “Oh yes, boy. Imagine this. The year is 1980 with no cell phones in sight. You talk up a pretty lady at the local bar and hit it off. You tell her about your new construction project, and she wants to go see it.” “Uh huh.” “Well then ya take her there! You and her all alone in a skeleton of a home, as you said.” “Wouldn’t it be a little more private back at your own house?” “More private, sure, maybe. But much messier.” I paused. “How so?” “Well, you don’t just take a girly down to a construction site at night just to get your diddly fiddled with. You take her for... ya know.” “No, I don’t know.” “For the easy disposal, boy.” “Disposal…?” “Ya cut the girly up, or do whatever your preference is. Ya do whatever ya wanna do with her, and ya put her under the house. Ya bury her and your stained clothes under there too. Once the job’s done, no one’ll ever see that stuff again. It’s gone. Eventually, a brand new house is sitting on top of your deed.” The bus rolled to a stop. “Well, this is my stop.” He stood, patted my shoulder, and I recoiled. He walked off the bus. The only thing running through my mind was a memory. I was a kid, no older than six. My friends and I were playing hide and seek. I hid in the crawl space under my front porch, and when I was hiding, I found a pair of boots half-buried in the dirt. The exact same type of boots I was wearing then, on the bus. The exact same type of boots we’d found in the crawl spaces of every house in our neighborhood.",

      "content": "This story is a retelling of something that happened to me when I was seven years old. As the years have gone by and I’ve grown up, I’ve realized that the story cannot possibly be true, yet I can’t shake the feeling that it is. It happened in Tokyo, in the subway station. I was standing with my father when I saw the demon, a monstrously tall and furry creature with leathery black wings and a snout like an anteater. I must have stared at him for close to ten minutes before he finally spoke, in a soft mutter that was clearly intended for his ears only. “This human is creeping me out,” he said. “It almost looks like it’s looking right at me.” “I am looking right at you,” I said. The demon nearly jumped out of his skin. “You can see me?” he asked. “Yes. Can’t everybody?” “Not unless they’re in the fifth dimension.” “Am I in the fifth dimension?” I asked. “Your mind must have slipped over here by mistake. What were you thinking about before you saw me?” I thought for a moment, and then grinned. “Trains.” “Oh, well trains are the link between our dimensions. I guess your mind must have just wandered over here. Either that or you’re going crazy.” “I hope I’m not going crazy,” I said. “Being crazy is a good thing in the fifth dimension,” the demon replied. I laughed. “Do you have subway lines in the fifth dimension?” I asked. “Of course,” he said. “How else would we get to work?” ”You’ve got wings!” I said. “Yes, but who wants to fly? Taking the train is so much faster, and if I fly to work I’m all sweaty when I get there.” “So what do you use your wings for?” I asked. “I put them over my head when it rains.” “Can I see?” I asked. “Sure,” the demon said. My hair blew back as he swooped his enormous wings over his head. I laughed again. “You’re funny,” I said. The demon laughed too, but then his expression changed. “Are you okay?” I asked. “You seem sad.” “Yes, yes.” the demon replied, not looking at me but at something behind me. “Say, would you like to see a magic trick?” “Okay.” The demon reached up and tugged a big rainbow handkerchief out of his snout. He must have pulled out twenty feet before he ran out. “That’s funny.” I laughed, but I stopped when I realized I wasn’t holding my dad’s hand anymore. I looked around and saw the subway station had disappeared, replaced by flowing green meadows that were full of old trains. “I can’t see the subway station anymore,” I said. “That’s okay,” said the demon. “Sometimes it’s better to see what isn’t there instead of what is.” “What do you mean?” “Sometimes when I’m bored or sad, my mind slips off to the third dimension, and I see people like you.” “That’s funny,” I laughed. “Can you go to other dimensions, too?” But the demon didn’t answer, he was looking up at the sky. “It’s starting to rain,” he said, whooshing his wings up over his head. Warm droplets of rain hit my face. “Can I get under your wings with you?” I asked. “Not now,” he replied. “You’ve got to go home.” The world began to shimmer and flow together like different shades of green and golden paint, spinning around faster and faster in circles. I started to feel a little sick, and I closed my eyes. The world stopped spinning, but warm droplets of water still fell on my face. I opened my eyes and saw my mom crying over me, but I didn’t see my dad. “Where’s dad?” I asked her. “Did he bring me home?” “Yes, darling,” she said, although she didn’t look at me when she said it. “He brought you home and then he had to go away.” “Oh,” I replied. “When will he be back?” “I don’t know,” she said. My dad never did come back, and it was years before I found out the truth: he had killed himself that day. That morning he had written a note to my mother explaining that he intended to bring me along and step in front of the train with me. My mother found it when she got home from work and called the police, but it was too late to stop my father. The witnesses say that just before he jumped I pulled away from his hand and ran off, fainting right after. But one of the witnesses, a little boy around my age, said that he saw something take my hand and lead me away from the speeding train. He said it was a monstrously tall and furry creature, with leathery black wings and an anteater’s snout. x",

      "title": "I work at NASA. We made alien contact yesterday.",
      "content": "Part 2 - I can't tell you who I am, and I can't tell you the name of the program, but what I can tell you is that if what they say is true, we're in trouble. Now, we didn't make contact in the way you would think we would. We didn't beam out an episode of The Office towards Andromeda and hear back from alien critics. And we definitely didn't meet them face to face. We found another way to communicate. Something, apparently ancient humans had figured out as well. There are countless dilapidated ancient structures around the world, and some of them, not all, but some, were communication arrays. At least a handful on each continent. I'm sure you'll be able to think of a few after I describe what we did. We've been working on this technology for a while. There has been a long standing theory that sound has a much larger part in the universe than just being random vibrations. That the universe is simply a bunch of vibrations and sound, and if you find a way to manipulate those vibrations properly, you could do things that seem impossible. We proved that yesterday. By creating an extremely, extremely, EXTREMELY, precise echo chamber, and playing certain frequencies into it, at precisely the right volumes, and the exact right timings, we broke some sort of barrier. Nothing really happened, visually at least. We had run countless tests like these with tiny, minute differences, and this one seemed pretty mundane. There was a slight unnatural thrumming, the glass between us and the echo chamber shook in regular intervals as if we were playing a bass heavy song too loudly. The first thing that tipped us off that something was happening was that once we turned the speakers off, the thrumming didn't stop. My three coworkers and I could all feel this thrumming in out chests still, kind of like being next to a very loud drum. We talked for a moment, before we all fell silent. There was something else now. It wasn't a voice. It was, some sort of, intellegent vibration. I can't explain it. It was like a voice was inside my chest, but it wasn't speaking, I could just feel what it was saying. My cohorts and I debated on the exact wording afterwards, but we all agreed on the overall messages each time. Like I said, they weren't really talking, so I'll do my best to phrase it in ways that get across what they said, in the way they \"said\" it. \"Wooooaaaahhh, you guys are back?\" Is what I felt in my chest. My colleagues and I stared at each other in utter confusion. One of the spoke up. \"Hello?\" He asked hesitantly. There was a silence for a moment, before the thrumming spoke back. \"I think I have it set right now, say that again?\" \"Hello?\" I repeated back to it in place of the other scientist. \"Yep, there it is.\" He said quickly. \"You guys figured it out again! That's crazy!\" It exclaimed. This wasn't what I was thinking the first human/alien conversation was going to go. I wasn't even sure that this was first contact at this point though. \"Who is this? What is this?\" I asked loudly into the open air of our control room. \"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give you details like who we are, but, what this is, is the ultimate form of communication in our universe. Your ancestors figured it out briefly too.\" With some quick deduction on how it was wording things, I think each of us figured out what we were talking to was alien in origin around the same time. \"Where are you from?\" I asked. \"You have to be close.\" Hell, with the way we were talking back and forth, they had to be REALLY close. It takes communications to Mars a few minutes to get there, just because that's as fast as light is. If we were talking this quickly back and forth they basically had to be on Earth. \"I guess you wouldn't know. We didn't tell your ancestors. We didn't think they'd get it. Let me do some math real quick.\" It was about a minute before it spoke again. \"What you see as your observable universe, thats not the whole universe. Not even close. Multiply that by about 15, and thats about how far we are away. And theres a lot past that.\" We all looked at each other. It was speaking utter bullshit to us now. That was impossible, we'd never be able to communicate, ever. Physically impossible. We explained that to the chest-voice, and we were met by an equal level of confusion. \"Why are you still using light as a yardstick?\" It asked incredulously. Suddenly, its voice grew slightly dire. \"You're still not advanced enough. You don't even know.\" \"Know what?\" One of my friends asked. \"You are dead center in the Life Abyss. There is no life on any planet around you, for more than ten of your observable universes around you in any direction. Its a universal mystery how you're even alive.\" It spoke grimly. Never in my life had I felt smaller, more insignificant and more alone. It continued. \"And there is a reason for that.\"",

      "title": "Last night, I got a reCAPTCHA. There was something horribly wrong with it.",
      "content": "Have you ever seen a photo reCAPTCHA? Instead of a checkbox, it’s a low-quality photo split into 16 square sections. It’ll say something like: “SELECT ALL SQUARES WITH STREET SIGNS,” and you have to click every square that contains a street sign. At 11 PM on Sunday night, I got one while downloading free stock images. It was a photo of a path through the forest. SELECT ALL SQUARES WITH PEOPLE. Okay. That was easy enough. In the center, there was a jogging woman in pink shorts. She took up a few of the middle squares, and I clicked them all. I pressed VERIFY. It didn’t work. SELECT ALL SQUARES WITH PEOPLE, the message said again. I took off my glasses, placed them on the table, and squinted at the image. No. She wasn’t the only person. Several feet off the trail, at the very edge of the image, I could see it. The edge of an arm clad in a black sweatshirt, with a pink thumb poking out. I triumphantly clicked the two squares containing it. VERIFY. The image blinked as it refreshed. Then the same text popped up, as if to taunt me: SELECT ALL SQUARES WITH PEOPLE. I rubbed my eyes and stared at the image. The trees cast low-resolution, blocky shadows across the path. The woman’s ponytail swung to the left, mid-motion. Patches of yellow sunlight dappled the surrounding forest. I studied some of the darker shadows, far from the path; but none of them matched the silhouette of a person. I glanced to the edge of the image. No. The image had changed. The arm at the edge of the photo was now further in the frame, taking up three squares instead of two. Bulky shoulders and dark jeans followed it. And the jogger was just slightly further down the path – as if she’d just taken a step. The touchpad was slick under my fingers. My heart pounded in my chest. Slowly, I dragged the cursor over the three squares and clicked them all. VERIFY. The image blinked. SELECT ALL SQUARES WITH PEOPLE. I leapt back from the computer. The image was different again. The man was further in the frame, taking up five squares. His hand was stretched out towards the jogger, just inches from her shoulder. And the jogger… She was turned towards him, eyes wide. Mouth open in a silent scream. Click, click, click. I furiously clicked all the squares. VERIFY. Loading… SELECT ALL SQUARES WITH PEOPLE. The man’s face was finally in frame. The hood of his sweatshirt was pulled tightly over his head. A translucent Halloween mask poked out from underneath, pressed against his features. His hand was latched onto her arm. She was screaming. Click, click, click. VERIFY. The image disappeared. I’d passed the reCAPTCHA. \\\\\\* I reported what I’d seen to the police. At first they thought I was crazy, but as I gave a detailed description of the images, they frantically took notes and asked me questions. The woman matched the description of a local woman, Kaylee Johnson. She went missing a week ago, during an afternoon jog on the wooded Lakewood Trail. She was never found. BD",

      "title": "I just started working the night shift at my university library. I found an envelope with rules that weren't in the employment manual.",
      "content": "What the hell? I sat behind the security desk at my university library holding an envelope that I assumed was meant for me. \"To the New Guy\" was scrawled on the front in jagged script, and I supposed I was the recipient because it didn't get any more new than I was last night. I was scheduled to work my first night time shift (12-4am) at my university library. The hours didn't deter me at all, I'm a serial insomniac and my class schedule was structured so I could stay up late and sleep in the next day. This luxury had the unfortunate side effect of limiting my employment options, and in order to stay somewhat afloat in the sea of student debt I was floundering in, I couldn't afford to remain unemployed. ​ When I heard about the night shift at the library from my friend Valerie who I attended high school with, it seemed like a perfect match. I can't reveal the specific school that I work for, but suffice to say it's a large university in the southern portion of the United States. Anyway, Val worked the early morning shift (6-10) and she mentioned that the guy who worked the late night shift, some guy named Flanders, had quit a few days prior. When she told me the hours and confirmed that the pay was at least north of minimum wage, I jumped at the opportunity. After spending a week slogging through the three departments you have to send paperwork to in order to become an official university employee, my bank account was in desperate need of that first pay day. ​ So anyway, last night was my inaugural shift, and it being a friday night, the library was expectedly dead at midnight when I relieved my new colleague Tory from her post. The employment manuals I was required to read had prepared me extensively for what was by all indications going to be a mundane four hours. I started at the security base, a big wooden desk the size of a tank underneath a huge glass window embossed with our university sigil in the library atrium. Here I would stay for the first thirty minutes of my shift and perform some clerical tasks like checking the book detectors and ensuring the patron counter worked correctly. After those first thirty minutes I was supposed to make my rounds about the library, an inconceivably large building, that (according to the employment manual) required about 2 miles of walking to complete a perimeter sweep on all four floors. When I settled into my chair behind the behemoth desk, I was exasperated to find the letter. Oh great I thought. More bullshit protocols to read. I tore open the envelope to find a sheet of yellow legal paper with numbered lines following a paragraph of writing in the same style as the print on the outside of the envelope. Dear new guy, DO NOT throw away this list under ANY circumstances. This is your bible, your map and your survival guide all in one fucking succinct document. I didn't have to leave this shit for you, but my hope is that by leaving this behind, I'll help to curtail your learning curve a bit. Lord knows it can be a steep one. Anyway, the rules listed in this document are not optional. They aren't suggestions and they aren't advice. They are a code that you must adhere to or some terrible shit can happen. You wouldn't understand without experiencing it for yourself which is exactly what this letter is meant to avoid, so listen up. If you get through this first night, I'll leave more rules for you tomorrow. Rule #1: Never look at the hallway safety mirrors in the basement corridor. Keep your eyes low and walk swiftly. Rule #2: You will encounter an unfathomably tall man in a gray suit. Do not look at his face. Answer any question he asks you with \"no sir\" and he will go away. Rule #3: Stay out of the atrium from 2:15-2:16 every night. It's better if you don't see it. Rule #4: You will hear some horrible fucking sounds from study room 219J on occasion. Don't ever open the door. Rule #5: Always walk beside the book shelves in the west portion of the fourth floor, never between them. Rule #6: If you hear tapping coming from the glass window behind you at the security desk, DO NOT turn around. Rule #7: At 12:15 you'll see a heavy man in a tweed suit hurry past you clutching his briefcase. When you see him walk past you, tell him \"today is not the day, friend.\" He'll look relieved, nod and walk out of the library. If he gets up the stairs, you're already too late. I was so caught up in reading the letter that I had forgotten to check the student ID of the person who had just rushed by the security desk. I remembered the protocol with a jolt and looked up to call out to the offending student just in time to watch a man, clad in a tweed suit, clear the stairs and slip out of sight onto the library floor. ​ Part 2",

      "title": "There’s a Man In the Baby’s Room",
      "content": "It’s odd that I was dreaming about my daughter the moment before I opened my eyes and saw her peering at me beside my night stand. In the inky darkness of my bedroom I could just make out her six year old outline: her hands threaded together at her waist, fulfilling her dubious mien when disturbing someone of authority, chubby cheeks that always pulled her lips into a smirk, that curly blonde hair she got from her mother who was delicately snoring beside me. I was groggy and no sunlight had penetrated the windows yet so I knew it was the middle of the night. “Lucy?” “Daddy, there’s a man in the baby’s room.” Such sinister words from the sweetest voice. In a flash, I ripped the covers from my body, waking my wife in the process, then raced down the hallway, past the pictures hung on the wall, and into the bedroom on the end. With a simple flick of a switch, I was exposed to my two-month-old son’s room: the mint colored walls, the boxes of gifted diapers from the baby shower, a basket of plush animals, a tub of pacifiers and wipes. But behind the crib where my son, Noah, was sleeping was something appalling. An intruder crawling through the window. The intruder craned his neck when the light blasted on and alerted him of my presence. It was then when I noticed the knife. The man was large, with greasy long hair and an unkempt beard. He smelled of body odor and that sour, putrid smell of vaporized drugs. I leapt into action before he could achieve a sturdy footing or leverage the knife to his advantage. I skirted the crib where my son still slept and removed a heavy bookend from the bookcase, then, as unsupported baby books tumbled off the shelf, I bludgeoned the intruder in the arms as he flailed and teetered on the window sill. After the intruder took several missed swipes with the knife, my aim became focused on his head. After my weapon made contact with his skull a few times he withdrew into the backyard, lumbering awkwardly around our flower bed before hobbling over our fence and disappearing into the dark street. I picked up Noah, who thankfully, was still sleeping and oblivious, and held him firmly against my chest. “What’s going on? Why is the window open?” I heard my wife ask behind me as she came into Noah’s room. “Call 911, now. We just had an intruder.” “What?” She laughed. “Now,” I demanded, loud enough to vocally project my fear but unintentionally lifted Noah from slumber. She phoned the police as I flipped on every light switch in the house, especially the exterior ones, and cruised through the rooms with Noah on my hip, doing my best to calm him. It took two laps through the living room but eventually he was calm enough for my wife and I to talk after her phone call. “Will you tell me what happened?” She asked. “Yeah. Sorry I yelled earlier. I was just emotional, ya know?” “It’s okay. What happened?” “Somebody was trying to break into the house through Noah’s room. I forgot to lock the window after we painted his room. Remember, we opened it for ventilation? I’m so sorry honey. Something could of-” “Stop it,” my wife demanded. “Noah’s okay. You’re okay. I’m okay. Everyone is fine.” “You’re right.” “Police are on their way. They’ll find the guy.” “He won’t be hard to pick out of a lineup. Some drug-addled thief looking for a score.” “What made you wake up? Was Noah crying?” I paused for a moment to consider an answer then looked at my curious-eyed son. “Yeah, Noah’s crying woke me.” “I feel terrible. I slept right through his crying fit.” “Don’t worry. Everything turned out for the best. How about some coffee, hun?” She went to the kitchen and I heard the coffee pot being washed. I took Noah to the hallway and propped his body up on my side so he was eye level with the photographs that lined the hallway. I showed my son a picture of a six year old girl with blonde curls that flanked a grin between chubby cheeks. “That’s Lucy, Noah. She’s your big sister.” Noah, with tiny, stumpy fingers, reached out and planted a palm on the frame. “I always knew she would be a great sister. She died before you were born, Noah, and your mother and I miss her everyday. But it’s good to know she’s still looking out for her little brother. ”",

      "title": "I am a child psychiatrist and there is something very off about the kid I am treating.",
      "content": "To say Ethan was the smartest twelve-year-old I've ever met would be an understatement. According to his school records, his first stroke of genius hit around the time he was in second grade when he multiplied three-digit numbers in his head while the other kids were just learning to add using their fingers. He has always been fascinated by mathematics, particularly probability which wasn't even covered in the syllabus yet. His teacher immediately requested Ethan's parents to consider him skipping a few grades, maybe even take a few tests to see if he was a genius. The Jones' were against that idea completely; they just thought it would be too much work in their already hectic life. However, the absolute lack of attention or love from Ethan's parents isn't the reason why he is in my office every day at 4 P. M. sharply. Frankly, I don't think that bothers him. He's not all too popular in school either, considering no kids wants to be friends with a know-it-all that could predict the outcome of Monopoly with the help of some probability. That's not what we're addressing here either. Ethan has been sent to me because he was the only one present at the crime scene when his 19-year-old baby sitter Kristin was brutally murdered by the serial killer who had escaped from jail a couple of weeks ago and was on a killing spree. Well, he wasn't exactly a witness because while Kristin's head was being badgered with a hammer, Ethan was too busy counting the tiles on the bathroom floor. It was unfortunate really, but fate would have it that Kristin met the pattern of this rogue killer's previous victims. The Jones' returned home to a bloody corpse in the middle of their living room, and their young boy seated on a chair in the dining hall, playing on his iPad. It was missus Jones that believed her son required a psychiatrist given god knows what he might have witnessed that evening. She wanted to ensure if he was still normal. My sessions with Ethan haven't really been all that fruitful. I tried to keep the conversation going many times, but all I'd get in return were a few shrugs and maybe a half-hearted \"Yea\" now and then. Today, however, I decided to dive right in and talk about that gruesome evening. \"It was a dark time for the entire town you know,\" I spoke. \"The police didn't see it coming, nobody did. What were the chances?\" \"I did.\" A voice! A sentence! That was a breakthrough for me. \"What's that?\" “I had seen the man come to our house and stare every evening for a week,” Ethan spoke. “Who?” I pressed. “The bad man who killed Kristin.\" “I would see him from the bedroom window, I knew the police were looking, I saw the news and I knew he was going to do something bad.” “I also knew he would’ve done it on a Tuesday or a Wednesday because that's when mom and dad don’t come home for a long time.” Ethan continued. “The chances were 2 out of 7.” I felt a chill go down my spine. It was peculiar to see a child talk about such an event with not even a hint of remorse. \"Why-\" I began, \"why didn't you say anything, you could've saved her life.\" “Kristin never liked when I spoke about math, she called it weird,” Ethan replied. “Besides, I wanted to see if I was right.”",

      "title": "My Daughter Has a Disturbing and Deadly Talent",
      "content": "Six words. So innocent, and yet, they had ruined everything. “Daddy, look what I can do.” I had turned, smiling, to see my daughter’s newest magic trick. I stopped smiling when I saw it. My heart stopped, my blood ran cold--a disturbing reminder of things past. I grabbed her by the shoulders, a little too hard. Made her promise to never tell another soul about what she could do. I made her swear so many times. She was crying by the end. Her face was ugly and contorted, her nose dripping snot. But she promised. I always knew that would not be the end of it. I knew what I had to do. Slip some sleeping pills into her drink, and cover her face with a pillow, like I had done with her mom. But I could not bring myself to do it. I loved her far too much, even more than I had loved my wife. And as she grew older, looking more like her mother every day, I knew it was only a matter of time. I still remember the night my wife told me, the night of our fifth anniversary. She had bought my favorite scotch, cooked us both some thick steaks, and sat me down at the dining room table. Our baby son was sleeping soundly in his room. “I have something important to tell you,” she said. Her tone sent chills trickling down my spine. “I’m pregnant,” she said flatly. My breath caught in my throat. I smiled. She did not. “I don’t understand,” I said, breathlessly. \"Isn’t this good news?” My wife’s lips pursed into a thin white line. “It’s a girl,” she said. “I can feel it.” I waited for her to explain why she was upset, but instead, she started talking nonsense. “The girls in my family…” she trailed off. “We all have a special…ability.” I shook my head. “O-kay?” I said, my mind a question mark. “And what is that?” My wife frowned. “It’s better if I show you.” She lifted the steak knife from beside her plate. Before I could stop her, she violently slashed open her wrist. I sent my chair clattering to the floor behind me as I lunged for my wife. I grabbed her arm so hard. But what I saw did not make any sense. Her arm was slashed down to the bone, but the blood did not flow out. “It won’t come out unless I let it,” said my wife. It was then the blood began to flow. Down her arm, then up, into a shape. It detached and rose up, forming itself into a face, floating in midair. My wife’s face. Then spiraling back down, like a funnel, into her open arm. The flesh knitted itself back together. That night, my dinner went untouched. What happened next was all my fault. But, in my defense, I felt my trust had been betrayed. I did not know where to turn. Weak and weary, I turned to the arms of another woman. Of course these things always come out. When I came home that day, my wife was sitting in one of the wooden dining room chairs. She had moved it to the middle of the living room, so that she was facing the door when I came in. Our baby daughter was snoring gently in her room. I could hear our son as he watched cartoons in his own. As I looked into my wife’s eyes, I knew that she already knew. She stood up. My blood ran cold. Then I realized that it wasn’t just a chill, my blood was actually getting colder. My wife walked slowly towards me. “I can freeze you from the inside,” she said. “Burst all the blood vessels in your body. I can boil you alive. I can make you bleed from your eyes, your ears, and every pore. And next time, I will.” My heart stopped, and I collapsed unconscious to the floor. By the time that I awoke, my wife had already found my lover, and done the last one she had threatened me with to her. After that we always fought, and my wife began to lose it. My mother died from a cerebral hemorrhage. My sister died from a stomach bleed. She never admitted it, but I knew that it was her. I had no choice, I had to kill her. And now, I wondered if I should have killed my daughter, too. My heart throbbed with guilt as I thought back to the first time she had shown me her magic trick, all those many years ago. I knew I could have stopped this all with a pillow and some pills, just as I had done with my wife. She said it was an accident. And maybe it was. But as I stared down at the body of my son, covered in blood that had exploded from every pore, I didn’t really care. x",

      "title": "I found my suicide note from years ago. I didn't write it.",
      "content": "I'm a pretty happy guy. I left state for college after high school, got a degree in psychology, and now work as a counselor for high school\\-aged kids. My little brother Mack is happily married with a two year old son, which makes my mom turn her attention to me, heckling me about when I'll be able to give her more grandbabies. Life has been very good, but I've recently discovered something that may turn everything upside down. My dad needed help cleaning out the attic, something which he said hadn't been done \"since Reagan was in office.\" I agreed to help, but my brother wouldn't be joining us since he had work. I had only been in the attic a handful of times throughout my entire childhood, so being up there again felt surreal. Dust and cobwebs coated every box, chair, and trinket in sight. I almost had two heart attacks thanks to a couple of rats scurrying around, but my father and I managed to sort through a lot of things, figuring out what was needed and what we could throw away. While my dad took a break, going down to the kitchen for a drink with my mom, I continued to curiously scour the attic. That was when something colorful caught my eye. It was one of my old comic books, lying unceremoniously on an end chair in the corner. I picked it up, waves of nostalgia surging through me as I admired the front cover, which depicted my favorite superhero, the Hulk, raising a car over his head, his teeth clenched. It had to have been almost 15 years since I had last seen that book. I was surprised at how good a condition it was in; The rats hadn't touched it. I flipped it open and began thumbing through the pages, enjoying a little piece of the past that had been forgotten. As I neared the middle of the book, however, a single sheet of white paper, folded horizontally, slipped out and drifted slowly to the floor, coming to land at my feet. I kept a finger on the last page I had stopped on, so as not to lose my place, and bent down to pick up the paper. Opening it, I began to read the message that had been written: I can't take it anymore. I wish that someone could understand what I'm going through, but no one ever will. Mom, I love you so much and I hate to do this to you, but it's the only option that I have. Dad, you did your best for me and Mack, but still, I have to go. By the time you read this I know that it will be done. Don't tell my friends the truth about what happened; Don't bury me, either. I don't want to be worm food. Mack, you were the best brother in the world and just know that this is not your fault. I'll be singing with the angels and watching over all of you from now on. Darby I stared at the note for a long time after I finished reading. I read it again and again, not knowing whether or not this was a joke. If it was, then it was cruel and I didn't think that anyone I knew was capable of doing such a thing. I stared harder at the words. My heartbeat hammered against my ribcage as I pondered the possibility of the note being...legit? The handwriting was very similar to my own and written in orange ink, my favorite color pen to use when I would write in my journal or when I would write stories when I was younger. My head was spinning. Could it be possible that I had written this and simply suppressed the memory? I couldn't recall any negative experiences that could have made me consider killing myself, and I was sure that seeing something like this would bring such experiences to come back to me. But they didn't come. \"Darbs?\" I jumped, spinning around and hiding the note instinctively behind my back. My dad was standing near the entry to the attic, a confused look on his face. \"Everything okay?\" \"Yeah, Dad, I'm fine, thank you. Just uh...a little thirsty, I guess I should have taken my break too. You mind grabbing me a glass of water?\" \"One glass of water, coming right up!\" he replied, but as he descended the stairs, I could see him watching me closely. As soon as he was out of sight I folded the note into a square and stuffed it in my pocket. I waited until I finished my water before telling my dad I needed to get some errands done, and that I would help him finish the attic another time. I went home and immediately tried comparing the handwriting in the note to my own. My current handwriting was a lot neater, but I could totally imagine myself as a teenager or preteen writing the way the message was written. Then again, if someone had been trying to copy my writing style, then that would explain the slight differences. After a couple hours of questioning my childhood I decided to sleep on it. Maybe I would call my brother and ask him if he remembered anything traumatic happening when we were younger. I lay in bed for hours, but just as I was about to drift off, I received a text message from my mother. \"You found it, didn't you?\"",

      "content": "We finally had two weeks off at the same time, Richard and I. “Let’s go on a road trip! Somewhere random, somewhere we haven’t been yet. What do you think?” I wanted to leave enough mystery for this idea to be intriguing, and win out over the desire to spend our hard-earned vacation time at home doing spring cleaning. “Well...” Richard pursed his lips as he weighed his options. I was the spontaneous one, while he tended to opt for more responsible ways to spend time. I put on my best combination of alluring smile and pleading eyes. “Come on, please? I promise when we come back we can spend the entire rest of the time cleaning every nook and cranny of this place.” “How about up to Maine?” Richard cracked a grin. Three days later we had an Air BnB booked and the SUV packed. It had been so long since we had been able to take a trip like this together. I was determined to make the most of it; I spent the better part of the work day after the decision to go researching small seaside towns and activities. The drive was estimated to be just over 7 hours according to Google maps. While we had a bunch of podcasts and games ready to go, I knew I was going to succumb to my desire to nap on long car rides. There is something about the sound of tires on the highway and the purr of the engine that soothes me. Just as expected, I fell asleep about 4 hours in. A blaring horn startled me awake, with a semi trailer flying past my window to confirm the source. I rubbed my eyes. “How long was I out?” I looked for the sun to see if I could estimate the time. “I learned in Girl Scouts how to tell the time from the stars, but I can’t seem to find the Sun. Must be about to set, huh?” My stomach growled so I turned my attention to my purse at my feet. “Are you hungry?” I asked as I dug around in search of a snack. “All I have in here are mentos and I have no idea how old these are. Is there an exit soon? We can pull off for some food.” I looked back out my window to check for one of those huge blue signs listing restaurants or rest stops. “Hon? What do you-“ I hadn’t looked at Richard yet. When I glanced at him just then I noticed he was staring at me. Right at me. Just his head was turned 90 degrees, a smile frozen on his face. “What?” I asked, a smirk creeping to the side of my mouth. We used to do this all the time, playing driver’s chicken. It didn’t take long for my smile to wear away, though. This wasn’t chicken. Normally whoever was driving would always glance back at the road or give up after about 5 seconds. Richard wasn’t giving up. “Richard, look at the road!” I whipped my head from his eerie smiling face to the road in front of us. “You’re going 80 miles an hour! This isn’t funny! You’re going to get us killed!” I screamed as a red Honda changed lanes right in front of us. Somehow, Richard smoothly changed lanes right around the car and back. I was looking right into his eyes that whole time. He hadn’t turned away from me, not to look in the rear view mirror, not out the front windshield, not even a little to the side. His eyes were locked onto mine, his smile never faltering. The weirdest thing was how his eyes looked. They were always my favorite feature of Richard’s. Deep mossy green, with perfectly long eyelashes. But now, they seemed darker somehow. It took me a few moments to realize that it was his pupils. They were slowly dilating, swallowing more and more of his iris into darkness. That was an hour ago. No matter what I did he would not look back at the road. I tried to turn his head, scream, plead, cry, I even slapped him at one point hoping to break him out of whatever trance this was. The only time he moved was when I tried to grab the wheel from him. I won’t try that again. Even though Richard won’t look at the road, he never hits anything or anyone. We’re still driving north, and I don’t know if he’s going to stop when we reach our vacation town. I don’t know if he is even my Richard anymore. I don’t know if I can call the cops, will they believe me? I’ll sound insane telling them my husband, whose eyes are completely black now, won’t stop driving the car and is just staring at me. Maybe I should try that anyway, I don’t know. I do know one thing, though. We have to run out of gas eventually. Part 2",

      "content": "Michael Zinsky wasn’t my usual type of client. He wasn’t a spurned lover, looking for revenge. Or a murderer, looking to snuff out the witnesses to his crime. Or a husband, hungry for his wife’s insurance policy. He was just an ordinary guy, looking out for his sister. “I wouldn’t normally resort to… such drastic measures. But Harold has become so awful. Treats her like garbage. Doesn’t give a rat’s ass about her, or anything, except for that stupid band he sings in with his work buddies.” He blew his nose loudly. “You understand that – right, Switchblade?” I winced. “Uh, that’s just my alias, Michael. You shouldn’t… like… actually call me that in casual conversation.” “Then what should I call you?” I blinked. Clearly, he had never done anything like this before. “Uh, do you have the cash?” His eyes darted around the diner. Then, from his pocket, he pulled out a wad of hundred-dollar bills. “You can’t just – they’ll see it!” I hastily threw him one of the napkins. “Wrap it up in that. And do it discreetly.” He wasn’t discreet – but, thankfully, the diner was nearly empty at this hour. “It’s twice your usual rate,” he whispered, very loudly. “I wanted to give you a big tip, so you’ll do a good job.” A tip? You’re not ordering an ice cream cone, Michael. You’re ordering a hit. But I took the cash, smiled, and buried it deep in my pocket. “And I don’t want you to kill him.” What? “Michael, you know I’m a hitman, right?” “Yes. But Nancy needs his income – she’s been a housewife for the past twenty years. No work experience, no education past high school. There’s no way she could support herself on her own.” “You could support her, with the cash you just gave me.” He shook his head. “I’ve tried. She won’t let me. Cares too much.” I sighed. “Well, okay. Suppose I did take you up on this… job. What do you even want me to do to him, if not kill him?” “I don’t know! Scare him. Threaten him. Just make him stop being so terrible to her.” “But it’s risky business. I mean, he’ll know what I look like, and –” “You’ll go on Sunday morning. He’ll be napping alone in the house – won’t even see you come in.” Michael looked down at the table, and then added: “It’s the only time he’s ever alone in the house. The only time… he lets her leave.” My belligerence evaporated, and I felt a pang of sympathy. “It’s that bad?” He nodded. “Okay. I’m in.” The house was a tiny little thing, shoved into the gap between a massive brownstone and a dilapidated food mart. It would be a challenge to do it without any witnesses. Good. I like a challenge. I snuck through the backyard, creatively using the various bushes and fencing to hide from onlookers. I then stepped into the open window, like Michael told me to. The knife was heavy in my hands. I turned left at the kitchen, and crept into the living room. In the center stood a microphone, a music stand, and some sheet music – presumably for Harold and his band. Nancy’s needlepoint supplies were pushed into the corner, taking up as little space as they possibly could. I walked into the next room. And there, in the armchair, sat Harold. Fast asleep. I retrieved the chloroform from my pocket. With the grace of a dancer, I lay it against his nose. And then I set to work. I visited Nancy myself a few weeks later. I like to do that sometimes. Pose as a friendly neighbor, see how their lives have changed in the wake of my work. Yes, I know it increases my chances of getting caught. But, as I said, I like a challenge. When she flung open the door, her eyes were bright, and she wore a smile. “Hi! I’m Smith Baker,” I said. “Just moved here – a few houses away from you, behind the food mart.” “Oh, how nice! Please come in.” She led me into the living room, and I smiled. The music stand and other equipment were thrown haphazardly in the corner; Nancy’s needlepoint was sprawled across the sofa, taking up as much space as it possibly could. “Smith, this is my husband, Harold.” He just stared at me. Still, silent, pale. And then he started shaking wildly, clawing at the raw, red mark across his throat. “Oh – sorry – I should explain.” She sat down, with a small smile. “He’s not trying to be rude. It’s just that… well, he had an accident, a few weeks ago. And now he can’t speak, I'm afraid.” She patted his arm, comfortingly, as he clung to her. “Or sing, unfortunately.” Hmm. An “accident.” That, mysteriously, cut his vocal cords – And left the rest of him untouched. I could see Harold’s hands shaking, his lip trembling. I wonder if he was thinking about the first thing I said to him, when the chloroform wore off. If you don’t treat Nancy right – I’ll slit your throat again. And next time, you'll lose more than just your voice. I smiled at Harold. “Would you like a cookie?” I asked, holding out the tray. “I baked them myself.”",

      "title": "My son would not stop crying",
      "content": "My son would not stop crying. I sat in the living room alone. The house seemed to shift at every scream he would bellow from his room. I tried to close my eyes and center myself. Crying was normal. I knew this might happen when I became a mother. People warn you about the hard times, but you can never really know until it happens to you. I managed two deep breaths before the wailing started again. The sound was a cheese grater against my eardrum. It was something about the high-pitched nature of the crying. So damn desperate. So needy. I was no longer an individual person. I was the host for this fucking parasite. This disgusting mess of cells that nearly tore me apart when I gave birth to him. I loved him once. I really did. I tried so hard to do right by him. I let him sleep in my bed. I rocked him back and forth, his heavy skull pressed against my neck like a noose. He puked everywhere. His insides were always on my clothes or on the floor. Nothing felt clean. The screaming continued and I turned the TV on as a distraction. I didn’t watch the DVD again. Instead I found some cartoons. I turned the volume all the way up. Maybe the squeaky voices of the animated animals would drown out his god damn bellowing. But it only made the worse. The lady mouse on TV smiled and did a little dance while the boy animals watched and clapped. I turned it off. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. I froze. Even though I despised his crying, I didn’t want to go check on my son. And I didn’t want anyone else to either. I just wanted him to rot in his room and cry until his feeble vocal chords crumbled. But it might be the cops. I couldn’t hide for long. By neglecting his cries I might have made the situation worse. That fucking bastard. That useless waste of an egg and sperm. I got up slowly, smoothing my housedress as I rose. I walked to the door. With a deep breath I checked the peephole. It wasn’t the cops! It was Arianna, home from school! I must have lost track of the time. I enthusiastically opened the door and took her in my arms. She felt so good. So alive and healthy. She stepped back and dropped her backpack off her shoulder. “Why was the door locked?” “Just for safety, baby,” I told her sweetly. “Now there’s something I need to tell you.” “What?” She looked worried. Poor girl. “Let’s go upstairs.” I took her hand in mine. My son’s screams were quieter now but still very audible. Arianna seemed scared. Her little fingers held on so tight. We climbed the stairs and walked towards my son’s room. Arianna stopped. “I don’t want to go in there,” she murmured. “Don’t worry baby,” I said softly, petting her black curls. “You won’t ever have to after today.” “I guess okay,” she replied, squeezing my hand again. We entered the musty room. Bottles of beer scattered the floor like cockroaches. On the bed lay my son, covered in his own blood. The shotgun blast to the stomach had revealed his intestines but hadn’t killed him. He looked up at us with nearly dead eyes. His arms held his organs inside his body. His toes were cut off, lined up neat on the bedside table. His voice was close to death. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. A grin spread across my face. Arianna did not seem scared anymore. She looked at me and smiled. “Did you do this, Nana?” I kissed her forehead. “I saw the video your dad made. What he did to you was not your fault. I knew he had to pay for what he did.” The crying had almost completely ended. It was just small whimpers now. “He will never hurt you again.” Motherhood is not always easy. Sometimes you have to do things that hurt your child. On the flip side, being a grandmother is simple. Arianna is the only good thing that that worthless, disgusting mass of flesh ever did for the world. And I intend to keep her safe.",

      "title": "My girlfriend started the KonMari method of tidying up. She's starting to freak me out",
      "content": "My girlfriend started the KonMari method of tidying up a few weeks ago. At first, I thought it was a good thing. She'd been notoriously messy through most of our relationship, and I was constantly having to pick up after her. Once she started KonMari, she started donating all her useless crap, and generally kept things tidy. Things went south when she got obsessive about it. I found her sitting in the middle of the kitchen at 1 am a few nights ago. All our pots and pans, cookie scoops and George Foreman grills, were arrayed around her like she was holding a seance for Julia Child. \"What are you doing?\" \"We don't need these things,\" she said, distantly, not making eye contact with me. \"Actually, we do. I use that pot all the time to cook that fancy macaroni and cheese--\" She turned to me, slowly, her eyes locking on mine. \"They do not spark joy.\" I was going to argue with her. That this had gone too far. But it was 1 am, and I needed to get up early for work tomorrow. \"Okay, whatever. Do what you want with your stuff, but not mine.\" I woke up to an empty kitchen. Overnight she'd gotten rid of over 90% of the kitchen's contents. The only things that remained were 4 dishes, one set (!) of silverware, and the one pot I'd told her to keep. \"How do you expect us to eat?\" I asked, furious. \"You only kept one set of silverware. One. How are we going to eat at the same time?\" \"There are two forks,\" she said, in calm monotone. \"But one's a shitty salad fork. I'm not eating with that.\" \"Then, I will.\" She closed her eyes and leaned her head back in the recliner. \"We didn't need it, Robert.\" \"You're not the judge of my stuff. I did need that stuff. All of it.\" \"You'll find you're happier without it.\" I glanced at the clock. 7:25--dammit, I was going to be late for work. \"I have to get to work. But we are going to talk about this tonight.\" She nodded. \\\\\\ But we didn't talk about it. She worked late on a project she was behind on--probably because of all the tidying--and we ended up going to sleep without talking. It was 2 am when I woke up with a start. At first, I wasn't sure what had woken me. But then a scratching sound came from behind me. Like something dragging along the sheets. I was about to turn around, but then I heard a whisper. \"Does it spark joy?\" A light touch on my back. I froze. I wanted to turn around, but something like fear kept me locked in place. \"Does it spark joy does it spark joy does it spark joy?\" A frenzied, fast whisper. A finger stroked through my hair--then caressed my cheek. But it wasn't a loving caress, a caress I'd felt during kisses or cuddles or lovemaking. It was an analytical touch--robotic--cold--like a machine. What the hell is she doing? As I lay there, I tried to convince myself that she was playing a prank on me. But she doesn’t know I’m awake. It’s 2 am. And she’s never played even the tiniest prank on me before. Her hands prodded against my back. Icy cold. Fear shot through me. But I stayed perfectly still. Don’t let her know you’re awake. That was the only thing I could think. Stay still. Don’t move a muscle. The mattress shifted, and I felt something tickle my face. No. It was her hair. She was hanging above me. Knees on either side of my torso, leaning right over my face. Her long, straight blonde hair draped over my cheeks. I didn't dare open my eyes, but I could imagine her face hovering above mine. Dark eyes boring into my soul. \"Does it spark joy?\" she whispered, her breath warm on my neck. I felt her nose brush against my cheek, a finger stroke my ear. \"No.*\" The bed creaked and shifted. My eyes flashed open for a second, and I saw her rolling off of me. She pulled the covers over herself, snuggled against her pillow, and went back to sleep. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. When she left for work, I called in sick and stayed home. Now I'm packing up my things--what little is left of them--and making plans to live with a buddy for a while. I do not spark joy. I can't stay here.",

      "content": "I first wore the Airpods to the Stop and Shop. It was an incredible, other-worldly experience. I listened to the soothing voice of Neil deGrasse Tyson while picking through the broccoli. I learned about quasars while waiting in line for the deli. Things got weird, though, when I got to the checkout line. The cashier was one of the annoying ones. The kind that make cute little comments about the items you're buying, while you stand there in embarrassment. \"Oh, these are good,\" he said, as he slid my pack of lemonade iced tea across the scanner. Blip. I turned the volume up on StarTalk. \"These are so useful. Own a few of them myself,\" he said, as he scanned the car phone stand. Blip. He reached for the truffles. He looked me straight in the eye and said, \"More chocolate for your fat ass, huh?\" I stopped dead. \"Excuse me?\" I asked, slipping out my Airpods. \"More chocolate for your art class, huh?\" \"That's not what you said.\" \"What?\" \"You said…\" I trailed off, looking at his pimply, juvenile face. He looked so innocent. \"Nevermind.\" I walked out in a huff. Maybe I did mishear him, I thought, as I charged across the parking lot. After all, I was listening to StarTalk at the same time. Maybe the phonemes got all tangled up in each other. Or maybe he was just a jerk. I got home in a bad mood. Opened the box of truffles and inhaled three of them. Just to spite him. Then my roommate got home. \"Tara! Want to join me?\" I said, patting the cushion next to me. \"Nah,\" she said, over the low thrum of Kansas coming through the Airpods. \"I got to take off my shoes and just smell my feet for a while.\" I stared at her blankly. \"When are you taking your shower?\" she asked. \"Not sure, why?\" \"I'm going to sneak into your room and stalk your search history, like I do every night.\" \"What?!\" \"I can't believe you still stalk Adam on Face --\" I ripped out my Airpods. \"-- bok choy with chicken. Do you want some? I can make extra.\" I stared at her. \"Are you going to go through my computer when I'm in the shower?\" She paled. Then she ran into her bedroom and slammed the door shut. Did I mishear that too? No. There's no way. I packed a few things and left for a friend's house. When I got there, she had the TV on. \"The search is still on for MacKenzie Johnson,\" the newscaster said. \"If you have any information, please call the hotline.\" \"What's this?\" \"Some local woman is missing,\" Amanda said. The film cut to an older man -- MacKenzie's husband. \"Please, if you have any information on my wife's whereabouts, go to the police,\" he said, his lip trembling. \"I need her back. Please.\" Something stirred inside me. A whim. A realization. I grabbed my bag and reached inside. Pulled out my Airpods. \"Please, if you know anything about my --\" His voice changed as soon as I stuck them in. “Little bitch.\" My heart stopped. \"It was easy. She's so weak, so fragile. Just got the rope from the garage and --\" I yanked the Airpods out. His voice returned to halting sobs. \"Please, if you know anything, call the police.\" Oh, I will. I picked up the phone.",

      "content": "Sarah sat across from me, wearing a tinfoil hat. She’d put effort into it. Tinfoil sculpted neatly around her entire head, with a nice little bulb on the top. “Can you tell me why you wear that, Sarah?” I asked. Her eyes darted back and forth, as if the Government – or whatever entity she was afraid of – might hear her. “They’ll listen to my thoughts,” she finally whispered. “And then…” “I understand. But l can assure you – it’s perfectly safe to remove the tinfoil, Sarah.” “Really?” Poor girl. Her lip was trembling, and her eyes were wide with fear. What made her so afraid? Of the government, or aliens, or whatever else she thinks is listening in on her thoughts? We’d already investigated her parents. There was no evidence of any sort of abuse. So why was this little 8-year-old girl so scared? “I know you think, when you take off that hat, that something will listen in on your thoughts. And then, that’d be a disaster, right? Because maybe the government, or aliens, or whatever else is listening will use that to their advantage. They’ll stalk you, or try to control your mind. But that won’t happen, Sarah.” “But they’ll kill me. When they hear my thoughts, they’ll come in the middle of the night and –” “Ssssh. None of that is going to happen, Sarah. You’re okay.” “No, I’m not!” she said, tears brimming in her eyes. “I promise, you are. There’s nothing to be afraid of, okay? Nothing.” I leaned forward and gave her a smile. “Can you try to take off the hat?” “No, I don’t want to.” “Please? Try. For me. I promise – nothing bad will happen.” She looked around, her face growing pale. “You promise?” “Promise. I’ll even do the pinky thing.” She finally broke into a smile. Our pinkies locked. Then she slowly reached up for the tinfoil. She shut her eyes tight. She yanked it off. I jumped back. My heart pounded in my chest. “doctor. Taylor? Are you okay?” A ringing filled my ears. It gave way to whispers – talking all at once, overlapping and hissing. Some fell away, others intensified, until the words became clear: Take that knife from the cabinet. Stab her in the eye with it. Now. The voice wasn’t hers. It was low, deep, rasping. The kind of voice that scrapes at your mind, shredding your sanity. “Sarah?” I asked. But my voice sounded so small. And then I felt my body move. I clenched my muscles, tried to stop; but nothing happened. My feet shuffled forward, towards the cabinet. Towards the knife. Her eyes widened. She reached down and grabbed the tinfoil, pushed it back over her hair. Immediately – the voices extinguished. A dull ringing throbbed in my ears. “I’m so sorry,” she said, bursting into tears. “I didn’t want you to hear it, doctor. Taylor. That’s why I didn’t want to take it off. That’s why –” “It’s okay, Sarah,” I said. “You’re going to be okay. I promise.” But I wasn’t so sure that was a promise I could keep. Because now I knew. She doesn’t wear the hat to keep something out. She wears it to keep that voice in.",

After that, we will walk, hand-in hand, to her school. At her school, I will kiss her goodbye, pat her back, and tell her I love her. I will wait at the gate, waving at my daughter, until she disappears behind that corridor. I am a kind person. After sending my daughter to school, I begin walking to work. I smile at people I pass, giving them small encouragements as I walk on by. On the way to work, I also see many, too many, homeless people along the road. Out of the kindness in my heart, I never fail to dig out some loose change in my pockets to give to them, hoping to bring some relief to their suffering. I am a helpful person. During work, there will always be those few people, who don't quite seem to understand some simple things. But it's alright. No matter what kind of problems they face, from printer problems to Excel problems, I will always lend them a helping hand. I will put down my work, and help them until they figure out their problems. I am a selfless person. After work, I am not like everyone else. I don't get in my luxury sports car, and drive back home to lie on the sofa or stare at the television. No, not me. Instead, I will head to the nearby nursing home, to help volunteer there. I will help with the cooking, some cleaning, or maybe simply just lend a listening ear to the abandoned old folks. I enjoy volunteering there a lot, and the people there feel the same way towards me. As you can see, I am a good person. After volunteering, I immediately head back home. After all, my daughter is probably home already. The first thing I do as I reach home, is to give my precious daughter a hug. I will listen to her day carefully, and talk to her. Then, I proceed to the kitchen to prepare our dinner. I first prepare my daughter's favorite hamburger and fries, followed by my simple meal of meat, veggies and rice. Lastly, I prepare a bland bowl of porridge, in case someone gets hungry. Then we eat! We sit together in the dining room, and we eat together and share more about our day. Finally, after we eat, I do the dishes. I clean and clean and clean, and ensure everything is spotless. You might imagine that after I have done so much, it is now time for me to rest. But that's not right. I have one last thing to do. I grab that bowl of porridge and proceed to the backyard. I walk quickly and purposefully to the shed at the back, then open the dog-door. I quietly insert the bowl into the shed. \"Hello, your food is here. Consume it quickly, then push it back out. It's not much, but... Whatever,\" I muttered softly as I knock the door. Immediately comes a series of crying from the other side of the door. I block out the noise, smile to myself, then walk back to the house. And that's my last job of the day! I decide to go spend some time with my daughter in her room. As I walk in, I see her face light up at the sight of me. \"Dad, dad! Y'know the bully at school! He already hasn't been in school for a whole week. I'm starting to think that he's never coming back. I'm so happy!\" she shouts in glee. I smile at her joy, and reply, \"That's wonderful! Remember not to go into the shed, alright? There's lots of dangerous equipment there.\" My daughter nods and continues snuggling in my arms. I think: Don't worry child, I've taken care of him for you. You'll never ever be hurt by him again. I'll protect you, my beautiful girl. See? I am a loving, kind, helpful and selfless father. I am a good person. And no one is allowed to hurt my daughter.",

      "content": "My husband had an affair. I found out because he brought her home when he didn’t realize I was there. They burst through the door, lips locked, making out in our breezeway. When he finally saw me (after he had peeled her off of him) his mouth dropped open. She was one of his oldest friends and I had met her many times. We had even gone to her house to have dinner on several occasions with her husband. She wasn’t an innocent stranger that didn’t realize she was involved with a married man. He opened his mouth to explain and I shushed him. “I made you lunch. Come eat.” I said. They stood there, not knowing what to do. “Just come sit down. There’s enough for both of you.” They sat. “Baby- I... I don’t know what to say.” He began. “We... it... just kind of happened.” I nodded, handing them their plates and sitting myself. They both acted like they had never seen spaghetti before. I had made it just the way he liked it. He stared at me, searching for more words. She sat silent, staring at her plate, frozen. “How long have you been together?” I asked. “Baby, I think we shou-“ he began. “I said, how long have you been together?” I nearly shouted. I didn’t want to shout. She yelped like I had hit her. “Three months... we’ve only had sex once... we’ve just been talking...” he said. “Please don’t tell my husband!” She cried. I started laughing, it was just so damn funny. The mistress, the adulterer, worried about what this would do to her marriage. My husband attempted to cut in, but I was nearly hysterical. There were tears streaming down my face and I could barely take in a breath. “Look- I’m not doing this.” My husband finally said, standing up and turning to leave. He took her arm. “Let’s go.” “What do you think you’re doing?” I asked. “Leaving.” He responded. “I’ll take her home and be back later to talk to you.” “You don’t get to just walk out.” I said. “Not after-“ I waved my hand at her in a gesture of confusion. “This.” “I fucked up. I know I did.” His tone softened a little and he took a step towards me. “She means nothing to me... I love you. You’re my everything. I just... I don’t know. Made a mistake.” “It wasn’t a mistake! You didn’t make a mistake! You purposely carried on an affair with a married woman.” I said. “Well, maybe you should have listened to and talked to him more.” She said. “He’s not the only one to blame here, honey.” “Don’t ever talk about my husband like you know him. You know nothing.” I said through bared teeth. “Well, I obviously know something about him. Like how to turn him on.” She hissed. “Come on.” He said, jerking her arm. “I’m taking you home.” I jumped in front of them, blocking their way. “No. You will sit. Now.” I commanded. They sat back at the table, and while I would like to let you continue believing it was just my commanding presence, it was probably more the giant knife I had used to chop the vegetables that I was now wielding in my hand. “Eat.” I said. They stared at me. “EAT!” I yelled, brandishing the knife. They ate. We finally talked after dinner. She was a puddle of tears. He-he was ridiculous. “I never wanted to hurt you. I don’t want to lose you. I love you!” He was nearly begging. “You aren’t losing me and I’m not going anywhere.” I said, kissing his cheek. She stayed all day, and we talked. I made them drinks, and later in the day, dinner. After dinner we all went to bed. It’s been like that ever since. Every night, he sleeps between us in our now shared king sized bed. I don’t have to worry about him cheating anymore either, because his mistress is well within my reach. He’d become sullen and withdrawn after awhile, and I didn’t know why. After all, he got everything he wanted. He wanted me, he wanted her, he wanted to stay in our house, and in our bed. I let him have all of those things. Still, some days I’d see him crying. I’ll admit, I did take his phone away (avoiding temptation), and he had to start working from home while we rebuild trust, but I don’t understand what’s so upsetting about that. Last night I heard him talking to her. He kept saying he was sorry. When i walked in the room (they aren’t allowed to talk without me present) he begged me to take her away from here. He couldn’t keep looking at her. He was finally as disgusted as I was at the idea of him sleeping with her. I agreed, and I took her home to her husband. He broke down in tears when he saw her. I didn’t stay for the reunion, I had been watching through the trees. I was careful, and had parked my car down the street in the woods. I was confident she wouldn’t tell him where she’d been all these weeks. She was so worried he would find out about the affair, after all. When I got home my husband wasn’t in much better spirits, but he was better. I’m sure we’ll work it out. I am afraid we’ll have to get a new bed though. Rotting corpses leave such nasty stains.",

      "content": "You were born to change the world. I hated that. My world wasn’t perfect; in fact, it wasn’t even good. But human survival is based on our need for the status quo. This is true even when ‘business as usual’ is slowly drawing life out of us, second by second. We walk happily forward, somehow able to forget the fact that passing time is another way of describing death. My life, a wise man once said, is measured out in coffee spoons. You took all that away from me. And I hated that. The fear of caring for an entire human - and a helpless infant human at that – shook me to my core. I was so much more afraid of facing you than – well, anything – that nothing frightened me. There’s no fear of getting fired once you’ve already quit. So I walked into my boss’s office at the box factory and told him that I was worth more than he’d been paying me. I also explained exactly why he’d been losing money. Spoiler: he was just as afraid as I had been of facing himself and making difficult decisions. I’d known it for quite some time, and had been afraid to tell him. He promoted me on the spot. The bump in pay was completely neutralized by preparing for you. Dorothy wasn’t ‘the one’ for me to marry. We both knew it, and we were both afraid to let go. Then she told me that she was pregnant, and that I had to marry her or leave. You denied me the opportunity to stay comfortably afraid to move. So we accepted that we weren’t ‘the one’ for each other, but that the idea is probably based on a fantasy anyway. We embraced what worked between us, we accepted what didn’t, and we moved on together. I had never realized just how much time I spent doing nothing. Internet chat rooms, watching TV, hitting the snooze button, sitting on the couch, spending an hour getting ready for the day when I can make it happen in nine minutes, 19 minutes here, 13 minutes there – holy shit, I was wasting 24 hours of every week on absolutely nothing whatsoever. Were those things worth a day of my life? No, but I gladly paid the Reaper anyway, and I was agonized when I learned I’d have to give that up. But it turns out that’s just enough time to put you to sleep, pick you up, get food in you, clean the food that comes out of you, and repeat the process eight more times a day. I would have to construct my entire life around this reality. Eventually, you would grow old enough to handle those things yourself, and would never once show appreciation for my efforts. That’s what I’d signed up for without wanting any of it. Life was going to be real, and that challenged everything I knew. I hated the vulnerability. Because nothing can describe the raw terror of a grim-faced doctor explaining that there are “serious problems with the pregnancy.” You cracked open a nerve that I never knew existed. I would have lived, and died, placidly unaware of the horrifying knowledge that I’d been sitting on unused pieces of my soul. Those pieces were rotting away. Thank you for showing me how scary that is. And thank you for forcing me to push myself so far into my discomfort zone that I had to give up on doubting myself. There just isn’t time to question whether I’m strong enough when my child is suffering. It turns out that doctors know more than they say at first, insurance has more than it gives at first, and I’m more of an asshole than I believed at first. I know it sounds like that last part is a bad thing, but believe me when I say it’s not. If you have a terrible relationship with someone, they usually drift away in time; and if you’re an asshole to someone, they probably deserve it. But even the biggest asshole in the world can’t bully circumstance into submission. We learned what it was to suffer. Another wise man once explained that suffering is life. Dorothy and I lived. And we loved – we loved because we were broken, rather than in spite of it. We watched as our status quo died without fanfare, and you were birthed with much drama. We watched as you struggled, and we struggled as you stopped. This letter isn’t an apology, because I have no inaction to confess. This is a note of thanks, as I sit here with you in my arms, watching the sun slowly rise on the first day after your birth. You were born to change the world. And in the twenty minutes that you lived, you did. ____________________________ FB BD Listen",

      "content": "\"FaceApp\" is an app that shows you what you'll look like old. This afternoon, I downloaded it, after a healthy dose of peer pressure. \"Come on. I want to see what you look like,\" my husband said, a grin on his face. Sure he did. He still looked handsome, with the spattering of silver hair and distinguished lines on his face. Me? I'd probably look like an old hag. The app loaded. I took a photo and scrolled through the options. I tapped \"Age.\" Then \"Old.\" The spinning icon showed up as it loaded. I held my breath. The image appeared. I froze. It didn't show me with gray hair, or wrinkles, or yellow teeth. No -- it was so much worse. My skin stretched over my cheekbones, thin and papery, a sickly shade of gray. My eyes were clouded white, the pupils barely visible. My dark brown hair had no gray -- but it was tangled and knotted around my face. Half my teeth were gone. I didn't look old. I looked dead. \"What? What's wrong?\" Alex asked. I quickly slid the phone out of his view. \"It's nothing. Just… don't want you to see me like this.\" That part was true. \"Fiiiine.\" He pulled away and have me a smile. \"I'll just have to wait until you get old, then.\" He winked at me. I gave him an awkward smile back. \"I should get back to work,\" he said, heading towards our home office. \"But we'll go out to dinner tonight, okay?\" I nodded. As soon as he'd left the room, I pulled the phone out again. Stared at the photo. It looked even worse than I remembered. As I brought it close to my face, I noticed a worm making its way through my hair. It had been nearly camouflaged against my brown hair. And my skin was mottled not with age spots, but actual holes. Then I realized. I can't be the only one. I pulled up a new tab and started searching. After wading through the various news articles on the app, I found a forum with a few users talking about it. Hey. When I did the FaceApp aging thing, instead of seeing an old person, I saw myself… like rotted and dead, and stuff. Did that happen to anyone else? A few replies indicated it had. Yeah, I look like some zombie, LOL I think it's a glitch. This is new software and they're still ironing everything out. I think they put it in there as a prank. I breathed a sigh of relief. But then, just as I was getting comfortable, my eyes fell on a fourth reply: I think there's something more to it. I don't want to scare you, but… my sister got the exact thing you described. Showed her all dead, like a zombie. She has terminal brain cancer. My heart stopped. I felt hot. Itchy. Dizzy. I stood up and swept a hand over my face, as if I expected to find the holes. The worm. Everything. I raced up, ran into the bathroom. Splashed water on my skin. The face looking back at me looked no different than it did yesterday. Or the day before. But the horrifying words now pulsed through my head. It didn't show me old... Because I'm not going to make it to old age. +",

      "content": "Reddit, you have to help me. Please. I don't know what to do. Today, my girlfriend Thea decided to go hiking. I know--I should've gone with her. But she always does her hikes alone because I slow her down. Usually she's only gone two hours or so. Now, she's been gone for nearly four. I'm considering calling the police. She should've been home by now. I've tried calling her, repeatedly--but she doesn't pick up. All I have is our text conversation from the day, and as I read it over and over I feel like something is terribly off. 2:33 PM Me: Seen anything cool yet? Thea: Nope. I'll send you pics when I get to the waterfall though!! 2:57 PM Thea: You're cooking dinner tonight right? Me: Yep! Chicken pot pie Thea: Yum!! So excited!! After that interchange, we didn't exchange any texts for about an hour. I wiled away the time constructing pylons in StarCraft. Then, around 4, she sent me a text. 4:06 PM Thea: I found the waterfall!! Below this text was a selfie. Thea, standing in front of a small waterfall, smiling at the camera. Arms crossed, cap covering her wild hair. Earrings--the turquoise ones I'd given her on our first anniversary--glinting in the light. I sent a text back. Me: You're cute ;) Then I stopped. Something about the photo… bothered me. I stared at her smiling face, blue eyes shaded by her cap. Her thick curls of black hair, brushing her shoulders. Wait. Her arms were clearly crossed. She wasn't holding the phone--there was no way she could be. Someone else had taken the photo. Or maybe she'd propped it up on a rock or in a tree. But she couldn't have taken the photo herself. I quickly shot off another text: Me: Who took that photo? She didn't reply to that, right away. So I'd left the phone on the desk and went downstairs to start prepping dinner. I pushed the creeping anxiety to the back of my mind and focused on the food, putting more effort than usual into cutting the onions. Call me paranoid, but my last girlfriend cheated on me and left my heart broken. Knowing someone else took that photo--and the fact that she hadn't responded to that text, when she'd responded to the others promptly--made me feel awful. Come on. She probably just asked some passerby to take her photo. \\Clunk--\\my knife sliced through the onion, hitting the cutting board with a full thump. But what if…? When I got back upstairs forty-five minutes later, I was relieved to see there was a new text. 4:53 PM Thea: thinking of you ;) I frowned. First, she didn't answer my question. Second, Thea doesn't usually send emotes or smileys. Gifs, sure, but not this. It was weird. Me: Thinking of you, too. Did you get my last text? Thea: i'll be back by dinner time <3 Thea usually didn't send less-than-threes to me either. That was more me. In any case, I decided to let it go. Me: Ok. I love you. <3 I unpaused StarCraft and played for a while. I was only interrupted by my phone pinging. I picked it up. A text. 5:37 PM Thea: i'm on my way back Thea: \\[image loading\\] The image popped up. It was another selfie. This time, she was holding the phone--I could see her outstretched arm in the lower part of the frame. And she was standing in a much clearer part of the forest--she must've been near the trailhead. I breathed a sigh of relief and began to type. Me: Awesome! Pot pie is already in-- My fingers froze. In the photo--just at the edge of the screen--there was something in the fallen leaves. A shadow. A shadow, just a few feet from her own, cast by someone off screen. It's after six now. Dinner is cold. I've been sitting here, my heart pounding, calling Thea repeatedly. Nothing. Except for one text that came in, as I was typing this up. Thea: i'm going to be home late. sorry. i love you <3 Somehow… I'm sure she wasn't the one who sent that text. Update here",

      "title": "My family waited 20 years to open a 100 year old time capsule",
      "content": "A father gives. I gave my family a house in 1999, and we wasted no time in digging up our new backyard garden with help from our seven year old son. He was the one that found the lump of red clay with a message stamped deeply into the surface: ATTENTION! TIME SENSITIVE! INTERNED THE FIFTH OF JULY NINETEEN HUNDRED AND NINETEEN OF THE YEAR OF OUR LORD. NOT TO BE OPENED UNTIL A MINIMUM 100 YEARS PASSAGE! My wife and I thought it was fun to imagine what our life would be like in 20 years; in its own way, the capsule really did help me focus on the future as my family grew. We kept the capsule was safely boxed up in the attic. My wife, son and eventually our daughter liked talking about the time capsule every July 5th, and where we think we would be and what we would be doing at the 20 year mark. It was a object of warmth. It reminded me of what I gave as a father when those 20 years passed as quickly as these words. In a family ceremony 20 years in the making, we cracked open the clay shell in the living room with cell phone cameras rolling about a month ago. We saw that the clay protected a near-mint condition plain copper box. I pulled it from its cast of clay and held the box to my chest for a bit as my family gleefully chanted for me to open it. I readied myself for some newspaper clippings, photos, maybe a few stamps. But upon opening, my son recoiled and let out the creepiest little diabolical laugh I have ever heard, a laugh I never heard from him before. He laughed for seconds straight before falling to a gasping and coughing fit. At the same time, my daughter said in a very concerned voice “guys... I can see me, us- outside my body...” My wife immediately jumped up from her seat and asked if I smelled leaking gas, or something else noxious. I had not idea what came over my family, as I saw, felt and smelt nothing different. I looked inside the tin box to find a yellowed piece of notecard below a layer of what looked like crumbling rock salt. The inside had a faint artificial, noxious chemical fume. I shook the crystals away to retrieve the card and read the fountain-pen written note: “Dear Person or Persona: If air touched us prior to one hundred years passage, study us, and weep- for we are and shall ever be outside your limits of comprehension, as these gems stay sealed from your kind's perception forever. However, if the instructions stamped upon this hull were heeded and a minimum of 100 years have passed- you, or those surrounding you, may have noticed a change, or a shift of perception, along with the presence of destabilized Crystalline within the capsule, remnants of inert state. These are signs that we have germinated and now found two new suitable hosts. When we find them, we will assume these forms and identities as we see fit. We seek no quarrel with you. Respect us mutually in that regard.” My 27 year old son's coughing fit started up again as he looked in the hallway mirror and ran a finger through his shoulder-length hair. My son mumbled something about not liking long hair and stated “I'm going to go cut off all my hair” in slower, deeper accented tone we never heard before before going to the bathroom. My 15 year old daughter, an award-winning gymnast, acted like a newborn giraffe on four ice skates when she tried to stand, laughing like she was high or drunk, and saying things like “These legs! These arms! I ride like a 3 horse team!” as she walked off on legs that became more fluid and confident with each step. When my wife asked me what the note in the tin said, my daughter ripped it from my hand, wadded it and ate it entirely, smiling the entire time. “Respect us mutually” she said in a strange, sing-song tone. My children stayed in their rooms all night and disappeared without taking a single thing with them the next morning. Two weeks later, my wife and I were diagnosed with separate kinds of cancers that were just now metastasizing. I guess that's why they didn't pick us. My wife is already mentally gone from this world, and I'm soon to follow. Sometimes I sit in the dirt, in the spot where my son found that cursed thing years ago, thinking. I was so obsessed with where I would be in 20 years that I didn't appreciate the days that passed between as I should have. A father is supposed to give. What did I give my children? There is not much time left for me, and I don't want to waste it wondering where my “children” are or what those things were inside the box anymore. No, not anymore. A father gives, and all I have left to give to you is my story.",

      "title": "What my wife gave birth to will haunt me until the day I die",
      "content": "In the eighth month of her pregnancy, my wife suffered a complication that required emergency surgery. When she woke up and I told her the surgery had been successful, her reaction was nothing short of terrifying. She didn't seem happy, didn't utter any words of relief, she just slowly reached down to her belly; her eyes widened for a moment, and then she began to laugh. It was a deep, humorless cackle that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I had to repress a shudder as I asked her what was wrong, but she ignored me. Instead of answering she began to scream; her whole body shaking as she thrashed and wailed; tearing out tufts of her hair and throwing them on the ground. I kept asking her what was wrong but she wouldn't answer. All of a sudden she went completely silent. She raised one hand up high. She paused for a moment--our eyes locked--and she brought her hand down with all her strength, plunging her long fingernails into her stomach. She tore at her stomach with such fevered ferocity that I was sure she would rip it open. I grabbed hold of her wrists and with great effort I managed to wrestle them down next to her sides. I had to use the restraints on the rails of the bed; once I did her whole body suddenly went limp, as if she was too weak to move. I sat down beside her bed; I could hear my voice shaking as I tried desperately to calm her down. \"It's alright, honey. It was just a small complication after all. Soon we'll have a beautiful baby boy. Our son. It'll all be worth it then.\" She slowly turned her head towards me. Her eyes were dead, devoid of humanity. She began whispering, her head lolling limply around on her shoulders. I leaned in close to hear what she was saying. It was just one sentence, repeated over and over. Get it out of me. She refused to speak at all for the next week; sometimes she would just lay there, totally limp and motionless. Other times she would scream and pull at her restraints until her wrists bled. I tried calming her down, telling her that this was a good thing; bringing her baby clothes and her favorite foods, but nothing I did could reach her. Finally, after a week, she went into contractions. As soon as the baby came out, it was clear that something had gone horribly wrong. The stench was unbearable; a sick, nauseatingly sweet smell-- but the baby was worse. Its head was overly large, its eyes bulging and bloodshot, and the skin was black and ragged; sloughing off in my hands when I touched it. It was a miracle that my wife survived the birth. I tell myself that we're lucky for that, even if our son was born dead. She seems to be relieved that the pregnancy is over, but I just keep going over everything horrible that's happened in my head. It tore my heart out when she gave birth to our third stillborn son, and it was even worse when I had to force-feed her those pills so that I could perform the surgery to put him back inside of her. If we're going to hold our marriage together through this tragedy we'll both need something to look forward to. I think I'll go tell her I'm ready to try again; maybe it will cheer her up. x",

      "content": "The broadcast on the TV read “THEYRE BACK. ONE HOUR.” I looked to my twin sister Jaime. She was just as confused as i was. My parents shot up, already started gathering supplies. What the fuck? Did they know something i didn’t? I jokingly thought to myself, is this some kind of Boomer thing i don’t understand? I tried to talk to them. They were not interested in explaining, too busy grabbing food and water. I’ve never seen my mom run before, but damn was she fast. She ran all throughout the house grabbing whatever she could. My dad, a man who never showed his emotions before, was visibly scared. I asked “what was going on? Is everything okay?” He told “shut up, grab whatever i could from my room i could handle, and bring it to the basement.” I grabbed what i could. My laptop, phone, chargers, blankets, pillows, and my purse. My parents already had their mattress half way down the stairs. Whatever we were preparing for, it would be for a long time. Our basement wasn’t very large, and kind of half assed furnished. It had an old couch from our previous house, a tv, and some bean bag chairs. Luckily, a bathroom too. My sister and i followed as my parents did, and grabbed my mattress as well. The basement wasn’t big enough for 3 mattresses, but i had a full one, and we could both sleep on it. What felt like 5 minutes, it had already been 55 minutes. My dad took a last look around the house, and walked back downstairs. Jaime, my mother, and i sat on the couch in anticipation. He put a large medal rod on the door, as to block things, i guess. He looked satisfied. He walked over, gave each of us a hug and told us that he loved us. The TV flashed, “DO NOT GO OUTSIDE. DO NOT INTERACT WITH ANYONE OUTSIDE. IF YOU HAVE NOT YET, SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY.” I begged my parents for an answer now. My mom sighed. “I really hoped this would never happen again, at least in our lifetime. I don’t know how long for, but it might be awhile. There are things that will be outside. They’re not... us. They look like us, they act like us, but they are NOT us.” My dad chimes in. “These creatures.. they pretend to be us. They feed on us, trying to take our place. Thank god we are more prepared now. We are safe down here, and must wait for the broadcast to tell us they have left. Last time it lasted two weeks, hopefully it will be shorter this time.” I have never heard of this before, i haven’t even learned about it in school. Why are we just hearing about it now? My mom exclaimed, “we should get some sleep. It’s late, you both know everything now.” I laid in my bed with my sister next to me. Too exhausted to even play my nightly game of solitaire. I woke up from my 8am alarm, i was supposed to go to class today. Nevermind that i guess. i looked out at the very small window we had. It looked like a nice day out. I wanted to go outside so bad. My neighbors were out, passing around a football, children playing as well. I heard my family talking outside. I almost called out for them. I turned around and looked at my real family sleeping on the floor. I realized what was going on now, they’re here now. The creatures, attempting to be us. TV was still flashing with the same message. I looked outside once again, and got a closer look at my “family.” They did look like us, but something was off. They limbs slightly stretched longer than they should be, the faces slightly distorted, the skin almost a whiteish hue. You would think if they are trying to impersonate us, they could have done a better job. Then, i heard my doorbell go off. Someone is trying to get in, and it is not us. part two",

      "content": "Growing up playing video games and watching war movies, I didn't think twice about joining the Marines so I could be in the infantry. I went through all of the training and unwelcome hardship that makes you really reconsider your decision. Anyway, I got stationed to a desert base known as 29 Palms - the largest piece of militarily controlled land in the US. It covers approximately 930 square miles in total. It's fucking huge, in Southern California, and a few hours from Mexico. When you're out that far, you start to see some shit. Anyway, fast forward to my first field op and me losing my shit. To put things in perspective as to how far away we are from civilization... the closest man made object is a 3 hour ride away. This day was particularly hot because it broke 130 as if the sun said \"I told I could!\", so we spent all day hiding under camouflage netting getting classes about various military tactics. Once the sun set, we set off into night to get some hard realistic training done. At night, we practice using our night vision optic to do simple shit like reloading and reading maps. It produces an image off of ambient infared light so you can actually see a lot more shit than the naked eye. The sky is absolutely cluttered with stars. I can see a shooting star every few seconds. The Milky way. It's pretty darn cool. Finally, after roaming around aimlessly for what felt like forever, we head back and we're granted a few hours of sleep. I lay down and start to drift off. I'm suddenly woken up after what felt like 10 minutes and I get up instantly. \"Get up bitch, you're on watch.\" God dammit. I get dressed and I stand my post dutifully like I'm told at the checkpoint. I'm given a radio and told to only lift the barbwire after it gets approved over the radio. It's maybe around 2am and everyone else in my company is dead asleep except for myself and an officer in the comm truck. All I can hear are the coyotes. I decide to start looking at the stars with my night vision. I hear a coyote yelp off in the distance and think nothing of it. A few minutes later, another Marine comes over a small hill in front me. Nothing crazy, probably taking a dump. He walks towards me but his eyes don't really reflect light. Rationally, one of us is probably dehydrated so I think nothing of it. He approaches me and after a few seconds of staring at me, he simply says: \"Can I come in?\" His voice didn't sound right. No inflection or questioning tone. Weird. I ask him what his name was and why he was out so far taking a dump. He tells me his name, Sgt Wright, and he ignores my dump question. Same weird voice. Granted, I'm new to the unit so I don't know anyone named Sgt Wright but I still had to verify it. \"Main, this is Roadguard 1. There is a Sgt Wright requesting entry. Over.\" \"Roadguard 1, this is Main. There is no Sgt Wright in this company and the closest unit is 25 miles away. Make sure- shit get the fuck back here right now. Don't let him or even look at him. Run..\" As the weird dude started to hear this, his face changed to severely angry. Like he wanted to rip my throat out and drink my blood. By the time I got back, everyone is awake. All of the vehicle lights are turned on and everyone is packing up. Scrambling into the trucks. We leave a lot of shit behind like the tents, water, and food and drive the entire 3 hours back. I never got an explanation from anyone but my squad leader who was a simple, backwoods kind of guy, who bluntly said that whatever I saw, wasn't asking to get through the gate. I never really understood what he meant by that until I discovered this sub. More to come. Trying to do these in chronological order as fast as I can. As you can guess, they get crazier as they go.

I just wanted some peace and quiet, for once. She stopped screaming. I took Lucy’s head in my hands and I told her I didn’t mean it. Told her I was sorry. Asked her to please wake up. She didn’t. I panicked. I took the body into the backyard and buried it in the flowerbeds. Resting amongst her beloved rosebushes. Lucy might have found that poetic. I went back inside, and puked into the kitchen sink. I had no plan, no cover story. Some nosy neighbor might have spotted me digging, or heard Lucy screaming. I spent most of the afternoon alternating between the bottom of a bottle and sitting on my bed sobbing, waiting to hear sirens. I downed half a bottle of pills only to throw them up minutes later. I was losing my mind. At some point, I must have passed out from exhaustion. The next morning, I awoke to the smell of frying bacon. You can’t possibly imagine my surprise when I walked downstairs to find Lucy waiting for me. Alive and well, not a scratch on her. I couldn't believe my eyes. At first I thought the events of the previous day had just been a terrible nightmare. I sat down at the kitchen table, torn between shock and overpowering relief as my wife set a steaming plate of pancakes down in front of me. She went on and on about some nonsense she had seen on TV the other day and I nodded along absentmindedly. Everything seemed normal. I almost fell for it. I hadn’t touched my food. Something about the lingering image, real or not, of burying the dead corpse of my wife had robbed me of my appetite. Lucy kept encouraging me to eat, but I just wasn’t in the mood. However, I noticed that she wasn’t eating either. I commented on it, but she just kept rambling on about TV like she hadn’t heard me. Finally, I decided that I needed to get back to work searching for jobs. I stood up from my uneaten breakfast, waving off Lucy’s protests, and started for the living room. On the way, I stopped to grab a beer from the fridge. As I went to throw the cap away, I noticed a shiny bottle in the trash can. RAT POISON was written on the label. Wondering where Lucy had seen rats in the house, I turned to ask her. Just in time to see her lunging towards me with a knife. I don’t completely remember what happened next. There was a struggle. The next thing I knew, I was standing over the body of my wife, who lay motionless on the kitchen floor. My arms and wrists were covered in cuts, but the knife was buried in the stomach of Lucy. Blood was everywhere. I checked for a pulse, but she was gone. For the second time, I had murdered my wife. As I tried to staunch the flow of my own blood, I was terrified. What was going on? Why had Lucy tried to kill me? Didn’t she know that I had already killed her? After I bandaged my arms, I checked the pancakes on the kitchen table. I couldn’t tell for sure, but after cutting them open and examining them closer, I thought I could smell a faint trace of rat poison. I was unsure what to do now. I almost called the police. But then I realized the body was gone. Blood still covered the kitchen, but there was no sign of Lucy. I searched the entire house, wondering if she had somehow managed to survive and crawl off, but there was no sign of her. The next morning, Lucy was sleeping peacefully next to me in bed when I awoke. Again, no wounds, no sign of injury at all. In fact, she looked… beautiful. More beautiful than she had in years. Her eyes opened. “Good morning, honey,” she said, smiling. “I have a present for you.” She went to reach for something next to the bed. I grabbed my pillow and smashed it down over her face. I held it there, long after her frantic movements had ceased. After I was certain she was dead, I looked at what she had been reaching for. A loaded gun lay on the nightstand. I took a shovel out to the backyard. I tore up the flowerbeds, as fast as I could. Soon, I found what I was looking for. Lucy’s rotting, decomposing face grinned up at me. Maggots wriggled over her, and the stench was overwhelming. She had been dead for days. I covered my face in my hands and screamed. I have killed my wife 12 times. Every morning, she returns, tormenting me. I haven’t slept, haven’t left the house. She could be waiting around any corner, watching. Awaiting her vengeance. Please, stop. Lucy, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I DIDN’T MEAN IT. Please, just stay dead.",

      "content": "This website is real, trust me. Try going on it, if you don’t. You can generate faces of people who don’t exist, via an AI. Sounds cool, cat-fishing bait, etcetera. I thought so too. I was fascinated by it, and I kept reloading it to see new faces, wondering how these very realistic people didn’t exist at all. Maybe some day a human would be born looking exactly like a face the AI generated, but maybe not. With the endless possibilities of faces, we would never know. Or so I thought. An hour ago, I was sitting in my bedroom, alone and I hit refresh. My face was staring back at me. At first I was sure it was a coincidence, but then I noticed, that exact same mole on my cheek. Everything about that face was the same as mine, and it was smiling at me, knowingly. I would be lying if I said I didn’t freak out right away. But I convinced myself that it was accidental, and that I should just take a walk. As I got out of my room, I saw my boyfriend sitting on the couch, looking at his phone. All I needed was some company, my mind was playing games on me. I walked up to him, and sat down, my head on his shoulders. He didn’t flinch, I wondered what engrossed him so much. “Hey, you”, I muttered. Nothing. What the fuck was wrong with him. I shook him, again nothing. There was a knock on the door and he got up, like I wasn’t right there. As he opened the door, my throat felt choked, as I realised that to him, it seemed like I didn’t exist. A beautiful girl walked in, and they kissed. It was so painful to watch. I ran into the bedroom again as they settled on the couch. I looked at my messages, my gallery. All empty. Was this some cruel joke? Was my boyfriend pranking me for Valentine’s Day? Would he kiss another girl for a prank? Knowing him, and his dedication to his foolhardy ways, he probably would. Deciding that this was the only plausible solution, I walked out, when I noticed that all the pictures were of him and her. Things we had done together, memories we had created, were all with her. Photoshop, maybe? I hoped. But then it hit me, I had been home before him. He’d come in a couple of hours ago, and we were together till about ten minutes before I walked into the bedroom and opened that godforsaken site. He couldn’t have done all of this in ten minutes! I guess it was just wishful thinking then, but I went upto him, shook him and said, through sobs, “I know it’s a prank. I’m crying now, please stop it.” The one thing he wouldn’t ever do is let me cry, and when he didn’t react at all, I knew that there was no prank. I couldn’t understand it. I knew I existed. I don’t think anyone else did though. And then, when I tried to recall my name, I had no idea. I opened Facebook, there was no login. No email accounts either. Panicking, I opened reddit. I am still logged in here, I guess anonymity has its benefits. I have no way of finding my name or anything that identifies me from this account. I don’t know what to do, where to go. I don’t know if I will always just be around, being no one and nothing, or if I will vanish by the time you all read this. All I know, is that I exist. And hopefully, some internet strangers know now too. Help me find me.",

Well, we did it together, actually…” “But how does that prove that he’s trying to kill you?” “He is, just trust me. You’ll be paid really well! “Listen, I don’t trust people who are trying to kill someone else. You have to prove to me that one, you have proof that he’s trying to kill you, and two, prove that his life insurance policy is real as well.” “Okay, well here are the documents from the insurance company, and I found a loaded gun that he purchased recently in our bedside table. Here is the picture.” “That still doesn’t prove he’s trying to kill you.” “Well then can you do some surveillance on him or something?!” She stood up, slamming the desk. “missus. Goodrim, we are here in a place of business. If you don’t like my services, you can ask any of the other hunters in this place, but if you are being rude to me, then consider yourself refused.” She sat back down, looking down, showing some sign of remorse. “I apologize, I just want him dead before me.” “Well, do you have the money?” “Yes. 20% of the life insurance policy, right?” “In cash.” She reached into her purse, and pulled out 10 stacks of $10,000. I counted them, totalling $100,000. “Alright, now do you have any other proof that he’s trying to kill you?” She pulls out her phone, and begins going through her text messages to her husband. “Read this. This is proof.” Honey, do you want to go for dinner tonight? Maybe Lalabella restaurant on Fifth, maybe around 7:30PM? “How is this proof? This just shows a man offering to take his wife out for dinner…” “Do you not understand? He’s trying to lure me to a restaurant!” “Yeah, a public restaurant, with many people around. He wouldn’t try to kill you there if he doesn’t want to go to jail…” I looked at her, questioning my own stupidity, asking myself if I could be more stupid than she was… But I wasn’t here to judge, I guess. “He doesn’t care, he’d get to cash in my life insurance policy! Do you not understand?!” “Look… missus. Goodrim, I’m just here to do a job. Whether you can prove to me that this case is a legit one is up to you. Whether I decide to take the job is up to me.” “Listen, you mongrel. I put $100,000 on your table to kill my husband, and I expect him to be dead by the morning.” “Alright, well. I’m just going to reach over here, to grab my big red DENIED stamp, and press down into the ink…” I looked up at her, and she was fidgeting. She wanted to play chicken, trying to put her balls on my table. I think she thought that with $100,000 sitting in front of my desk, I would just go ahead and say yes, but it doesn’t work that way. I only kill one person per year, and expect to get the highest payout. “I’m going to life my stamp off the ink, and move it clo----” “Alright, wait.” missus. Goodrim looked at me with anger, as if she just lost a bet worth $100,000. “Just do the job, okay? You can take my phone, take my bag. Here, you can have my 7 carat Diamond Tennis Bracelet as a tip, okay?” “Well, I still have to make sure that this is a sound case to take on.” I stand up from my chair, and step out of the room, closing the door behind me. “Cher, send it to the client please.” After about five minutes… ​ Ding Andrew Goodrim 00002.png ​ I step back in the room, and look at missus. Goodrim. “Here, take this.” “What is it?” “It’s so that I can begin the assignment. Take it if you want to proceed.” Without a second thought, she takes the pill and puts it in her mouth, takes the water bottle and gushes it with water before swallowing it. “Okay, now what?” “Well, let me show you something.” I pull out my phone, and show her the picture that her husband sent me. On the left, it showed that her life insurance policy paid $1,000,000 and that I would get a 25% cut. On the right was a hand-written note saying that she was deathly allergic to peanuts. Below was a transcript of the conversation that his wife and I were having, prepared by my secretary, which proved that she was trying to kill him. “This is proof that someone is trying to kill him. This is the proof I needed.” She put her hands up to her throat, grasping it tightly. She was choking. “What was… you give…?” “It was just a peanut in a dissolvable capsule.” “Epipen… In… Purse…” “Oh, the purse you gave me earlier? I’m sorry, but this is just business, your life insurance policy paid more.” She collapsed on the ground, lifeless, in front of me. I sit down, and begin to count the payment. “One, two… Ten. One hundred thousand plus… This bracelet. It looks nice on me. ​ \"Ma’am, Andrew Goodrim has wired the money. The total was $250,000.” ​ “Thank you, Cheryl. Here's a tip. Clean up after, will you?” ​ I throw one stack at her. ​ “I’ll see you next year.” ​ 9",

      "content": "I've been treating Alex for almost a year now, but the vague threats started around Thanksgiving. He'd fallen in love with a girl named Emma, and she didn't feel the same way. Typical high school heartbreak. The problem was, he wouldn't back off. He kept asking her out, and she kept rejecting him. He ranted about her every week -- she didn't appreciate him, she led him on, her friends mocked him, etcetera. I gently suggested that he give her some space, and he burst into a grandiose tirade about how all women are sluts. This wasn't the first time he's gotten angry. That's why his mom sent him to me in the first place. He had a history of outbursts and antisocial behavior, which led to other students alienating him. But this was the first time I felt afraid of Alex. There was a frenzied look in his eyes, like he wasn't really in control anymore. And it wasn't just anger. It was elation. When he came back the next week, he seemed much calmer, but that only made me more uncomfortable. I tried to casually comment that he seemed happier this week, and he told me that he had \"figured it all out\". I asked him what that meant, and his only response was a slight smirk. You know that feeling in your gut, when you know something is terribly wrong, but you don't want to believe it? That's the feeling that keeps me up at night. A few months ago, Alex was just an agitated teenager who struggled with making friends. He carried a lot of rage about his dad abandoning his family, but people can work through that stuff. That's what I'm here for. But now we're in a whole different realm. In last Wednesday's session, I did something I'm not proud of. Something that could cost me my job. I asked the school receptionist to interrupt our session and bring Alex outside for a phone call. The moment he left, I reached for his backpack and started digging. Regular stuff, like notebooks and binders. I flipped through the pages and found nothing but doodles and notes. What was I doing? I stuck my hand deeper into the bag and felt something. It was one of those old TI graphic calculators. I slid off the cover and tried my hardest to remember my Algebra days from high school. PRGRM. That's where we used to goof around. The first program was called EMMA. I opened it up, heart pounding: >1. WHO >2. WHERE >3. WHEN I pressed (1). >Emma, Christine, Sara, Chris. After that, as many as possible. Need 20+ for top 10. (2) >Probably chemistry. Maybe the library, when she's on her free period with the other bitches. (3) >December 17. Right before Christmas, like Newtown. Ruins the holiday for everyone. Hands sweating, I reached for my phone to take a photo. And that's when the door opened. \"What are you doing?\" Alex lunged forward and grabbed the calculator. \"Alex, we need to--\" \"You can't go through my stuff,\" he mumbled. Then he packed his bag and stormed out of the room. Shit. I thought to myself. Shit, shit, shit. I called the police first. They came over to interview me and said they'd take the report very seriously. They asked if I took photos of the calculator. Nope. Five more seconds would have made all the difference. Then I talked with the school. They said they'd work with the police to investigate. But last night, the police informed me that they had completed their investigation and found nothing of concern. Of course they didn't. Alex knew I'd report him, so he hid everything. Shit. We have our next session tomorrow -- the last one before December 17. He still hasn't canceled.

      "content": "36,400,000. That is the expected number of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, according to Drake’s famous equation. For the last 78 years, we had been broadcasting everything about us – our radio, our television, our history, our greatest discoveries – to the rest of the galaxy. We had been shouting our existence at the top of our lungs to the rest of the universe, wondering if we were alone. 36 million civilizations, yet in almost a century of listening, we hadn’t heard a thing. We were alone. That was, until about 5 minutes ago. The transmission came on every transcendental multiple of hydrogen’s frequency that we were listening to. Transcendental harmonics – things like hydrogen’s frequency times pi – don’t appear in nature, so I knew it had to be artificial. The signal pulsed on and off very quickly with incredibly uniform amplitudes; my initial reaction was that this was some sort of binary transmission. I measured 1679 pulses in the one minute that the transmission was active. After that, the silence resumed. The numbers didn’t make any sense at first. They just seemed to be a random jumble of noise. But the pulses were so perfectly uniform, and on a frequency that was always so silent; they had to come from an artificial source. I looked over the transmission again, and my heart skipped a beat. 1679 – that was the exact length of the Arecibo message sent out 40 years ago. I excitedly started arranging the bits in the original 73x23 rectangle. I didn’t get more than halfway through before my hopes were confirmed. This was the exact same message. The numbers in binary, from 1 to 10. The atomic numbers of the elements that make up life. The formulas for our DNA nucleotides. Someone had been listening to us, and wanted us to know they were there. Then it came to me – this original message was transmitted only 40 years ago. This means that life must be at most 20 lightyears away. A civilization within talking distance? This would revolutionize every field I have ever worked in – astrophysics, astrobiology, astro- The signal is beeping again. This time, it is slow. Deliberate, even. It lasts just under 5 minutes, with a new bit coming in once per second. Though the computers are of course recording it, I start writing them down. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0... I knew immediately this wasn’t the same message as before. My mind races through the possibilities of what this could be. The transmission ends, having transmitted 248 bits. Surely this is too small for a meaningful message. What great message to another civilization can you possibly send with only 248 bits of information? On a computer, the only files that small would be limited to… Text. Was it possible? Were they really sending a message to us in our own language? Come to think of it, it’s not that out of the question – we had been transmitting pretty much every language on earth for the last 70 years… I begin to decipher with the first encoding scheme I could think of – ASCII. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. That’s B... 0. 1. 1 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. E… As I finish piecing together the message, my stomach sinks like an anchor. The words before me answer everything. “BE QUIET OR THEY WILL HEAR YOU” ^(EDIT 2021: For film/reading adaptations, I am releasing this work under) ^(CC BY 4.0))^(.)",

      "content": "Okay so I have never been much of a reddit guy but have recently gotten on it out of interest of these “isolated staircases” found 30 or 40 miles in the woods. You know how it goes, a few hours pass and I find myself here. Anyways - I grew up in a military family (probably why i currently serve) and have heard endless stories about combat, barracks shenanigans and things of that sort so I never paid a whole lot of attention. One night my uncle told me a story i’d have a hard time forgetting, i realized this was because you never hear of ghost stories in the military. So here it goes: • One night around 3am an MP sits alone at one of the back gates of a small National Guard post in Mississippi. It was cold outside so he sat inside of his guard box with a small space heater and a cup of coffee. He would have to radio in every hour or so in order to let his command know that he was okay and nothing had occurred throughout the night. As he sat alone reading a book he heard a small wail coming from a few hundred yards up the gravel road he was posted at. It was too dark to see that far so he left the inside of his guard box to get a better look, at this point he was startled because the screams sounded like something out of a horror film, deep and sorrowful. To his surprise, after staring into the darkness for a moment, a young women appears. She was covered in blood and limping down the road. Still distraught and screaming she makes her way closer and closer to him, at this point the soldier takes off in her direction in order to provide her any medical aid he could. Once they meet she starts screaming that she had a wreck a ways up the road and her child was in the car. She begged him to “go save my child,” realizing how cold it was he wrapped his fleece jacket around her bloody body covering it in blood. He placed her back in the guard box and took off in a sprint down the road. He arrived to find a car flipped upside down and a small child unharmed and crying in the back. Once he removed the child and laid him on the road he went to check if anyone else was in the car. When he arrived back at the car he couldn’t believe what he saw, the woman from before bloody and dead in the front seat still strapped in. He removed her from the car and checked her pulse, she was gone. He grabbed the child and hurried back to the guard box in order to radio up to his unit, upon his arrival he finds his fleece jacket laying on the ground outside the box without a trace of blood on it. Hope y’all enjoyed this, it definitely gave me some chills when i heard it. People always associate ghosts with evil and negativity but in this case it just seemed like the mom’s unfinished business was simply to save her child and had no need to roam the earth once that was finished.",

      "content": "“I do not want to live without my cheese slicer.” “The cats are wearing shoes.” “The vegetables do not like vegetarians.” Sometimes, Duolingo, my smartphone language app, comes up with strange sentences. It always made me laugh. But, lately, there’s been a weird glitch with the app. I’ve been refreshing my German. My mother is a retired German teacher, and spoke it to me growing up. However, now, at 29, after years of almost no contact after I got married (she says she’s not homophobic, but gee, what a coincidence that she started acting distant after I married a woman), then finally somewhat patching things up, I have forgotten a lot. I don’t want to lose my knowledge, and German can be useful for work. I decided to take the placement test, then start from the basics again. My understanding is great, but I can’t spell and have little grasp of grammar or the “gender” of items. Everything in German has either a masculine, feminine, or neutral gender. It’s a pain in...der Arsch, I think it’s called? Anyway, the weird glitch I have been experiencing has to do with the questions that require one to speak in the language being studied. The app works fine, as does my microphone. I get the answers right. But I don’t think whatever the app is having me say is ordinary German. My skills might not be where they should be, but I know what German sounds like. This sounds similar, yet at the same time very different. It is written out in the same alphabet as German, but sounds...older. Rougher. I have recognized the word “Valhalla” a few times. The vowel sounds are different as well. My pronunciation is getting better, though. Still, this is confusing. I wrote a note to the app maintenance. Said, “I think there’s a problem with the German course. Some of the speaking practice questions aren’t in German, but another language. Possibly Nordic in origin.” And I sent them a screenshot of one such question. The response was quite quick. “We didn’t put that in there. Are you sure your app is up to date and you’re not using a hacked version or playing a joke for the Internet?” I guess I should have waited until after April Fool’s Day to send in the report of this weird glitch. But, since I don’t want to lose my 268-day streak of practicing, and the rest of the program is fine, I have kept using Duolingo. However, I did send a screenshot and recording of the app pronouncing the weird words for me, to my brother, who has traveled a lot, and to a German professor at my former university, hoping he would share it around with professors from other languages as well. While I waited for responses and kept at it, weird things have happened. I mean, okay, global warming has been causing weird weather patterns lately, but whenever I practice outdoors, and say one of the weird phrases, I hear thunder or see lightning, and often, a storm starts soon after. If I am working on it while walking or working out, I seem to hear a second set of footsteps behind me. A separate breath. This was unnerving, of course. So I tried to stop using the app, though I mourned the loss of my by now 280-day streak. It didn’t work. I lost some time the next day, and when I, for lack of a better word, “woke up,” I found myself in the middle of a lesson. I can’t seem to stop using it. And today, I saw something strange. I was practicing it, and came across one of the strange phrases while sitting on my patio, looking at a field in the park across the street. There was a clap of thunder that shook my eyes in their sockets, and I saw a huge, half-formed, grey figure come down from the sky. But, it vanished a moment later as I stumbled over how to pronounce the last word. Just a few minutes ago, I heard back from both my brother and the professor. My brother thinks the glitch is just Icelandic being mixed in, and after I sent him more of them, he still thinks that, though he’s confused by the total absence of modern words in what is supposed to be a 21st century language app, The professor had shared the glitch around, until finally, it reached a medieval history colleague of his. I received an e-mail with both of them copied onto it. It’s old Norse. And, given the strange happenings and the fact that I can’t seem to put Duolingo down, I am afraid of what will happen when I finally get the pronunciation right.",

      "title": "I taught my dog to talk through buttons and now I wish I hadn't",
      "content": "I taught my dog to talk. Not with her voice, but with her paws. I own a 3 year old bichon frise called Gidget. They are a remarkably intelligent breed, despite their yappy image. I taught her from a young age to do tricks and obey commands, and she was a bright and eager student. I always felt she had a lot to say. So when I saw videos on Tik Tok and Instagram of dogs who use programmed buttons to indicate their needs, I thought I might try it with Gidget. I bought a pack. Recorded my voice on the buttons. I kept it simple at first: I gave her buttons to make requests and to ask for things. Outside. Food. Water. Treat. Play. After she had mastered those, I added more. I gave her options about where she wanted to go, what things she wanted to eat. She soon learned to pair the buttons up. \"Outside. Park\" \"Food. Chicken\" It was amazing, to hear her preferences. To know why she whined or barked. As she grew more confident I added more buttons. These were more philosophical, and used concepts rather than nouns and verbs. I wasn't sure Gidget would be able to understand them, but she picked them up so quickly I wished I had introduced them sooner. We discussed the weather, dreams, emotions. She was soon able to tell me if she was happy or sad, tell me she'd had a bad dream, and ask for a particular toy for her playtime. I became obsessed. Her little brain was able to express so much more than I'd ever suspected. I added more buttons. Soon she was able to tell me her mood, ask pertinent questions with the \"Why\" button, make decisions based on what I suggested. She also liked to look out of the window and tell me what she saw. It was so interesting. Whilst I might look out of the window and see my neighbour carrying groceries from his car, Gidget would watch the same scene and tell me about the bird she had spotted, or stray leaf she had seen caught by the wind. I was able to see the world through her eyes. She'd been using her buttons to talk for over a year before things started to get disturbing. One day, she stopped playing with her favourite toy, looked into a corner, and walked over to her board. Very deliberately, she selected the button for Dark. I laughed. It was daytime,and the sunlight was shining into every corner. \"No dark, '' I told her. \"Light. It's day time. No dark.\" I used the buttons to reinforce my message. No. Dark. Light. Day. Gidget listened, but turned her little head back to the corner. After a few minutes she came back to her board. \"Dark,\" she said again. I'm afraid I shrugged. Shrugged off her words, and the message behind them. I may even have laughed. \"No dark,\" I said. \"Light.\" Gidget humoured me. She was a very clever dog. Sometimes whilst we played she would stop and examine a random wall, hover by her word board ready to tell me what she saw, but my previous reaction must have discouraged her. Time and again she would stamp on the button for Dark and I would look at where she looked and deny it. I added more buttons, and with those buttons came more unease. \"Dark. Stranger. No.\" \"Cold.\" I'd stand where she looked to show her it was okay. She would whine and cry and hit the Stranger button. It upset me a lot. After a while, Gidget stopped using her buttons. She regressed. She stopped asking \"Outside\" and would whine at the door instead. She stopped asking \"Food\" and would stand by her bowl and cry. I didn't know where I had gone wrong. I stood in the corner she hated more often, trying to understand why she hated it. It was cold there, colder than anywhere else in our home, but very welcoming. I found it soothing, for some reason. But the more I stood there, the more she cried. It started to get annoying. It was just a stupid corner. I'm not sure what to do. (Update) Gidget has regressed even more. She has started peeing in the house, which is incredibly frustrating. At first I brushed it off, then I took her to the vets. The vet said there was nothing physically wrong with her and said she seemed stressed. She's a dog?? What has a dog got to be stressed about? I'm getting sick of cleaning up puddles of pee. I feel like I should punish her. (Update 2) Gidget won't come near me now. I hold my hand out to coax her. She turns away. Idiot animal. I remember that I loved her once, but that was before I realised how useless she was. She won't even love me - the main reason I got a dog in the first place! I spend more time in my corner, and watch the little fluffy beast cringe in her bed. The bed I bought her that she doesn't deserve. I'm watching her now. I've been staring at her for hours now and she has done nothing except shake and cry. She used her buttons for the first time in ages earlier: \"Where. Mum.\" \"Mum. Bye.\" Stupid creature. Can't she see I'm right here? Or is it too dark? You can find updates here:",

      "content": "Each year on December 5th, a person in my hometown is brutally murdered. The police are at a loss. With each victim, a poetic story is left behind. Below are the stories from the past 3 years: Fredrik loved to smile, for he was always glad. Happy, warm, and gentle — never, ever sad. But Fredrik had a secret, one he only knew. This man loved to strangle children, he turned them cold and blue. The townsfolk never found them, for he was very smart. Fredrik took their corpses, and pulled them all apart. “It couldn’t be young Fredrik,” every one would say. “He is a man of God— we always see him pray.” The cold night came, and Fredrik rested his head. But soon he heard a scratching, underneath his bed. Fredrik trembled as he looked, oil lamp in hand. On his bedroom floor— the Demon had a plan. “Away with you beast, the night is dark and long.” “You have no business here, for I have done no wrong.” Krampus only laughed, as he shook his rusty chain. He hung Fredrik by the neck, until he writhed in pain. The links constricted, digging into skin. Fredrik then cried out, paying for his sin. He begged and pleaded, until his final breath. With a beautiful snap—Frederick bled to death. Krampus hung him out to dry. And all the townsfolk began to cry. But not the children, for now their souls were free. And under Fredrick’s body, the phantoms danced with glee. Greta loved herself, more than she could bear. She never had enough, and could never, ever share. Want was nevermore, it was only need. Her envy grew and grew, and with it came her greed. Greta needed more, but money wasn’t flush. So she stole from her family, it gave her quite the rush. “It is not enough,” to herself she would say. “I must have it all, there is no other way.” Into her grandparents’ home, Greta crept inside. They had many treasures, jewelry and gemstones pied. But when she looked about, wealth she did not find. Only ancient Krampus, with something on his mind. Greta shrieked and trembled, staring at his claws. She knew there would be no mercy from this evil Santa Claus. “You shall have the riches,” Krampus said with a grin. And he gave them to her, after peeling off her skin. Herman was a doctor, for that’s what he would say. And every single patient, they would have to pay. He cut, and pulled, and burned. And after he was done, for more he always yearned. This surgeon was a butcher, who had a taste for swine. With their bleeding flesh, he’d pair a fine red wine. The hunger took him— body, mind and soul. Yet this evil, it never took its toll. Herman was alone— in his chair he sat. All this human meat had made him very fat. He drifted off to slumber, and began to snore. Until an angry Krampus, bursted through the door. Herman could not move, he wet himself in fright. Krampus licked his lips, and let out a squeal of delight. First he gouged his eyes, and Herman could not see. Then Krampus filleted his tongue, it was tender as could be. Christmas is joyous- full of love and cheer. But you must remember- the one that we all fear. So be kind to one another, show love and heed this text. Or Krampus will find you, and you will certainly be next. The police are seeking any information that may help bring the killer to justice. As of this morning, three more bodies have been found in a neighboring village.",

      "title": "I've been seeing a man in my backyard for the past two nights - Update 3",
      "content": "[Original Post] ( [Update 2] ( [Update 4] ( Hello again everyone, If you have not read my last update I have since left my hotel and I took an uber to my friends house an hour away. As I got in the uber the driver had been waiting for me to come out and I got into his car. I nearly shit myself as he turned on his car to find that the car the one directly across from it in the parking lot was a grey volkswagen. I couldn’t tell if it was the same one from the night before, because A) this one had a license plate and B) I have never gotten a good look at it up close before so it could just be any other person's car. As we were leaving I looked up to the hotel and in one of the rooms there was clearly a figure looking out the window. I’m not jumping to any conclusions right now as to whether it was him. I’m not sure if it was the same room as mine. I’m honestly keep questioning myself at this point as to whether all this shit is real or just paranoia. Maybe the guy actually did find me and I was just about to be slaughtered, maimed, or worse, or maybe this is just a classic case of the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon and I am just finding ways to freak myself out. One thing that is for sure is that this guy is definitely still hunting me. I got a text from mister. Sullivan, Nick, or whatever the fuck he wants to call himself and I am still petrified after seeing it. At exactly 8:34 pm today, he sent me a video and the only other thing he’s said in the text was “I see you”. Video is posted. [Video] ( I am positively sure this is my house. Now I want to know when was the video taken. It probably was not taken last night as police were all watching my house, so that means he either took it the first two nights or as recent as today, and I’m really hoping that it's the ladder. If he took it today that means he probably still thinks that I am staying there. Unfortunately though, this guy seems far from stupid, and if he has stalked me enough to know my garage code he most certainly must have noticed I am no longer coming back there. Either way he is trying to terrorize me and he is probably trying to get me to flee my house for his perfect moment to strike. In some twisted way I expected worse. I don’t know what makes this psychopath tick, maybe dead animals, maybe dead people, or just seeing his victims crumble under all the stress he is inflicting on them. What I am dreading is if he actually manages to find me at my friends place. This guy we’ll call Tom (not his real name obviously) took up the mantle of protecting me, and if this guy manages to find me I will never forgive myself for putting this on him. I offered to pay him money but he refused, so for the past two hours we have just been doing nothing but drinking beer and playing video games to calm my nerves. Tom is a bit of a, hick I would say. He loves dipping, sitting on his front porch drinking beer, and he has a pretty large collection of guns (probably the best friend to have in a situation like this) just as you guys have been begging me to get ahold of. So all in all right now I am feeling the most secure i’ve felt out of all the days since this shit has started. I have informed the police about my situation and the video and they told me they had not seen a car park near my house at all in the past day. I gave them the number and they told me they will do their best to try to triangulate its position. Now that it’s getting late my friend and I have decided we need to start securing the place in case of intruders. His house has security alarms, he lives on a relatively busy street so no one can park near the house without parking in the driveway, and he has been staying off of social media as I have asked him to do for my safety. The anxiety hasn’t stopped, but this is the first time I have a friend by my side to help me with this situation so I feel a little better. He gave me one of his pistols and we started shooting in the range in his backyard despite having never shot a gun before. We are currently on his porch just talking as I write this down. I am very grateful for all your support for the past couple days guys. Updates will come as always everybody. Have a good night everyone, hopefully nothing notable will happen for once. Now we wait.",

      "content": "Flying is a major part of my job. Each week for the past twenty years, I've traveled from city to city on various business meetings. During that time, I've flown enough to join the million mile club. I love it, but there are aspects of flying even I can't handle. Crying babies, limited leg space, people listening to music too loud... the list goes on. Luckily, I've developed the perfect system throughout the years. It includes a neck pillow, a sleeping pill, closed shades, and earbuds. Unfortunately, during my last flight, the survival kit had gone missing during check-in. Without it, I was doomed to suffer through a long, sleepless flight. Of course, I was also seated behind someone who wouldn't stop crying. It wasn't even an infant as I had expected, but a grown-ass woman. She sat with her face pointed towards the window, and sobbed loudly. At first, I assumed she was afraid of flying. But, if that were the case, she surely wouldn't be to transfixed with the outside world. The thought of her being sad crossed my mind as well, but it didn't sound like it. She just seemed... broken. Before long, her whining had garnered the attention of the staff. A stewardess walked over with a concerned look on her face, and gently tried to start a conversation with her. “Ma'am, are you alright?” she asked. The woman didn't respond. She just kept staring outside, crying Non-stop. The stewardess gently shook her, yet she didn't seem to react. By then, people were getting worried. Whispers filled the cabin, people asking if she was on drugs, or if she'd suffered a mental breakdown. I wasn't as much annoyed, as I was worried. But, something about the situation seemed oddly eerie. I considered opening my own blinds, to see what she was staring at outside. Before I got the chance, I heard another person crying a few rows behind me. I turned around to see a man sobbing loudly. He too, stared out the window. His eyes were unblinking, and didn't seem to produce a single tear. In fact, his entire face was rid of all emotion. He just sat there, crying without moving his mouth. “Sir?” one of the neighboring passengers asked, as they leaned in to help him. No sooner had he peeked outside the same window as the man, before his eyes went blank, and he started sobbing with him. Then a fourth joined in... and a fifth. By the time we realized what was happening, half the plane had broken into an unbreakable rhythm of crying. “It's the windows! Close the damn shades!” one of the passengers called out. In a haste, we did as instructed. First we made sure none of the still sane people got the chance to look outside. Then we proceeded to close the blinds by the crying people. Each of us careful not to look outside in the process. As soon as we'd blocked their view of the sky, they instantly fell silent. One by one, their sobs stopped, and the plane fell into uncomfortable silence. I let out a sigh of relief, but the small victory was quickly squashed by a panicked gasp. “They're not breathing!” the stewardess called out. She was right, each of the previously sobbing passengers, had died in their seats. Without a view of the sky, their bodies had simply shut down. In the span of just a few minutes, half the plane had succumbed to an unknown curse. We attempted to resuscitate a few of them to no avail. In the end, we just sat in silence, all of us in shock at what had just happened. In the meantime, the stewardesses were trying to contact the pilots. They weren't responding, and we all knew what it meant… We'd lost them. After a few agonizing minutes of doubt, the stewardesses used their emergency code to open the cockpit. On the inside, we found the pilots crying unresponsively. We brought blankets inside to quickly cover up the windows, and removed the dead Pilots. From there, ground control gave us instructions, and aided us in landing the plane safely. It was rough, but we managed to get to the airport alive. Once there, we were met by a team in hazmat suits. Despite our explanation, they couldn't rule out a possible infection. As we expected, even after an overabundance of tests, nothing was found. To this day, I don't know what happened aboard our flight, nor do I care to find out what those poor souls saw outside the windows. What I can tell you with absolute certainty... is that I'm never setting foot inside a plane again. TCC",

      "title": "I participated in a dark web treasure hunt. It was a stupid-ass decision.",
      "content": "For my birthday, I decided to treat myself to a Dark Web mystery box gift. It was a service I'd used several times before, and they had never disappointed, sending heaps of useless, but funny things to my doorstep. “Happy birthday Trevor!” a note on the box read. I picked up the package placed on my doorstep, and noticed a letter attached to it. “There comes a time in every man's life, where their skills and knowledge has to be tested. With that in mind, I shall set you out on a treasure hunt. Please follow the instructions within the box, and for safety reasons, burn every letter once it has been read, or solved.” To my surprise the note was signed by Pete, my best friend since childhood. It was a neat surprise, but I was confused as to how exactly he'd gotten involved with the anonymous service. Whether he was just an active user there himself who'd recognized me, or if he'd been contacted by the website, I didn't know. Nevertheless, it seemed like a cool gift. My first clue would simply be a piece of paper with two incoherent words written on it. “VAN MACE.” Could it be a name? Maybe a location? I sat down with it, and contemplated the words in front of me. After just a minute, I realized it was an anagram. The letters just had to be rearranged to form a new meaning. “MAN CAVE,” was the hidden message. It was a reference to Pete's basement. A place we'd frequently spent our Saturday nights, playing video games and drinking whiskey. I burned the letter in accordance with the instructions, and quickly made my way to the man-cave. There, I used my spare key to unlock the door, half expecting a surprise party. Instead, all I found, was another clue. An ace of spades, and a picture. Both were pinned to a board with an unfamiliar knife. I removed the knife, and checked out the clues. The picture itself, was of a place we frequently went with friends, to smoke and relax. A beautiful field which no one knew about. It was just a short hike outside the city. I made my way there in about an hour. Our usual place was hidden in the shade beneath some trees. Once there, I noticed a shovel sticking out of the ground, on top of lay some fresh dirt. “Spade – Ace of spades. Very creative,” I chuckled to myself. Without hesitation, I picked it up, and started digging through the ground. After less than a minute, I hit something solid. Expecting another clue, I bent down and brushed away the dirt. As I put my hand on the cold surface, I immediately retracted it in shock. It was Pete, buried under the dirt, dead from multiple stab wounds to his chest. In shock, I called the police, devastated by the loss of my best friend. While I waited, I sat down and tried to figure out what the hell had happened. That's when I realized... That I had burned every note, and that my fingerprints were all over the murder scene. From the strange knife in the basement, to the key, and the shovel itself used to bury him. I'd been set up.

      "title": "What is water made out of?",
      "content": "When I saw the warnings on the TV, I instantly locked my door and barricaded it with the dining room table. I could hear people from other apartments doing the same. I ran to the windows and shut them. Nothing was getting in on my watch. My daughter walked out of her room, sleepily rubbing her eyes. “What are you doing, daddy?” She looked so innocent in her little pink pajamas. My heart swelled. I swept her up in my arms and kissed her forehead. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. Papa is going to make it okay.” The TV was still on. A man with shaking hands read a teleprompter. “Lock your doors and your windows. They can get in from any opening. Don’t open the door for any reason. They will lie to you, but don’t believe them. The National Guard recommends ear plugs.” My daughter clutched my arm tighter. Her long blond hair got in my mouth. I wiped it away and kissed her again. “Go back to sleep, Ava,” I told her softly. She looked up at me with big blue eyes. “I’m too scared, daddy.” “Okay. But you’re going to listen to headphones, alright? You don’t need to hear the TV.” I grabbed my iPad and loaded up a kid’s show. Ava settled down across the room with the headphones in. My eyes were glued to the television. The man was sweating now. “Authorities say they are targeting anyone within a 50 mile radius of the crash site. We are unclear exactly what they are. It is not an animal previously seen. It may have come from whatever caused the crash. It looks like a human.” “What is water made out of?” I turned my head and saw Ava with her headphones half off. I struggled to reply. “What…what do you mean, sweetie?” She pulls on her blond hair. “Water. What is it made of?” “It’s made of water. Just water.” I tried to turn back to the TV but Ava started crawling to me. Her small body gliding along the hardwood floor. “No, there are smaller things inside. Moldicues.” “You mean molecules?” She crawled into my lap. She stroked my cheek with her pale hand. I feel odd. With a scared voice I respond, “Hydrogen and Oxygen. Did you hear about them on your show?” “Yes daddy,” she said slowly. “But you’re wrong. There are two hydrogens. Two.” She holds two fingers against my arm. My eyes drifted back to the TV. The man and the woman were less anxious now. The man said, “Authorities are saying they will appear just like human beings. You may even believe you know them.” The woman laughed curly. “No, they will not appear like that. Nothing like that. Don’t you remember, dear?” He looked at her, smiling. “You’re right, dear.” I looked down at my daughter. Her white skin was bright against my dark skin. The contrast was blinding. Why did my daughter have white skin? Why did her hair keep getting in my mouth? Her blond hair… Terrified, I grabbed her tiny body and tossed her across the room into the wall. I heard a crack. Her shoulder popped and her elbow was bent the wrong way. A bone spurted out of her chest. She let out a small cry. In the darkness I realized her skin was not white. It was caramel. It must have been the light of the TV that made her look white. Someone knocked on the door. Her voice was sweet. “Dear, I’m home! For some reason my key doesn’t work.” I stood, backing up. Ava was bleeding onto the wood floor. She had stopped crying. The thing outside knocked again. “Open up dear!” The knock got louder. “OPEN THE DOOR, DEAR!” Ava stopped breathing. I held my breath. I could hear other apartment doors opening. Screams followed. The man on the TV was half eaten by his cohost. Ava’s show was still on, displaying a periodic table. A fish danced the tango with two hydrogens and an oxygen.",

      "title": "Women Must Serve Men",
      "content": "Growing up in a very religious home, I was taught that women must always serve men. Given the fact we were created from a man’s rib, it only made sense that we were put on this earth to be companions for them. I often used to dream about the day I would find my partner. Would he be handsome? Would he be strong but gentle? Would he be my provider and protector? My young mind had no idea what the years would bring. When I turned eighteen I met Jon. He was everything I could have imagined and more. Sweet, gentle, kind hearted; he was perfect. We had an advantageous marriage per the request of my parents, and it was magical. Winter had come and encased the grounds with a vast blanket of divine white powder, causing us to light several fires in its midst. The warm glow beckoned our guests with a dance of ice and fire. The ceremony was beautiful. Our family dog, Kenai even brought our rings down the aisle, gliding swiftly between the stones. Jon expressed his ever dying love for me in front of all our family and friends, and just like that, we were husband and wife. We set off for our honeymoon hours after and quickly boarded the plane to Bora Bora; a beautiful gift from his parents. The first day was perfect. We spent all of our time wrapped in each other's arm, filled with all the love our bodies could muster. I remember gazing into his dark brown eyes of heaven, asking myself how I got so lucky. Then, I watched as his mood slowly shifted the moment I mentioned our future children. “Let’s just hope our first is a boy,” he remarked. I stared back at him confused, why would the sex of our baby matter? I chalked it up to the fact that all men must dream of having a boy first, to carry on their legacy and last name. The next day however, his true feelings began to show even more. While at breakfast I watched as he ordered for me, mortified not only at his selection, but also at the authority that dripped heavily on his tongue. The rest of the day stayed true to the morning; no choices made that day were my own. When our honeymoon was over, things progressed immensely. I found that he thought my friends were childish and that I should make new ones. He also forcibly mentioned that I should quit my job and remain home, a request that when refused, resulted in pain and dark sunglasses. I begged my parents for help, pleaded with them to talk with Jon, but I always received the same reply. “You must serve your husband, Dany.” I would cry for many sleepless nights when I found out I was pregnant with our daughter. Jon was furious. “How could you give me such a weak child?” He would yell at me with such a darkness in his eyes, I feared for my life. I had to find a way to protect my baby from his wrath. My parents had given us Kenai as a wedding present, my one true companion in this dark world shaped by men. He collected most of my fear born tears with his obsidian fur; always there, always comforting. Last night Jon came home in one of his moods, destined to set my world aflame with his hands. I took blow after blow before something changed in Kenai’s eyes; he had, had enough. With the strength of a dragon he rose from his bed, eyes locked onto Jon’s throat. One moment, he had his hand clasped tightly around my throat, the next he was reaching for his own as Kenai tore into the chauvinistic flesh. I fell to the floor, hands covering my eyes as I heard my husband scream out in pain. The sound of blood gurgling in his throat serenaded the night; I was free. When Kenai had finished with his prey he pranced over to me with a warmth I had almost forgotten. With shaking legs I crawled to Jon, a part of me hoping he was alive, while the other rejoiced in his departure. When no pulse was to be found, I leaned heavily against the couch and sighed. How was I supposed to get rid of the body? Today I woke up to a text from my mother asking Jon and I to attend my younger brother’s graduation BBQ. A brief moment of panic coursed through my veins, before the solution hit me in the gut like the betrayal of a knife. I spent a few hours preparing a dish for the celebration, while Kenai danced at my feet. I made sure to throw him a few pieces as a reward for his bravery. Once everything was ready, we departed to my parent’s house. I informed my family that Jon was ill and wanted me to send them all of his love. They bought it. When dinner was placed on the table I glanced around at my family with joy in my heart. “Wow Dany, this meat is so tender and delicious. You must tell me your recipe,” my aunt smiled at me with a mouthful of food. I beamed up at her and nodded as I patted Kenai from under my chair. I looked down at my plate with pride. I had done my duty as a wife despite all of my tribulations. After all, women must serve men.",

      "title": "I just matched with my dead wife on Tinder",
      "content": "Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 I had numbly swiped left so many times in a row I almost missed it. I wish I had. My wife Allison had been dead for two full years. Yet there she was, on Tinder, smiling at me, in a photo I had never seen, looking older than she did when she passed. All of the air went out of the room. I skimmed through the rest of her profile. There was no writing, but three other pictures of my dead wife I had never seen before, including one with the Statue of Liberty behind her even though I knew she had never been to New York City. At least to my knowledge. The profile had the right name. The right after for if my wife had just kept living after July 2020 but her location was nine miles away. I swiped right and breathed for the first time in nearly two minutes. I struggled to sleep for the next 48 hours. Never getting a match. Ready to message Tinder and tell them someone was impersonating my beloved dead wife on their app and doing some kind of magical Photoshop to put her in pictures that never existed. The match came at 3:33 a.m., lighting up my phone. I was already awake. ‘ The match came with a message. Just a simple hi. The absolute worst in any situation, let alone this one. I mashed the letters on my phone as hard and as fast as I could… Who is this? Why are you doing this? And where did you get these pictures of my wife. She died of cervical cancer two years ago, you monster. I had to wait for another 24 hours before I got an answer. It came in the middle of the night again. Derek, I miss you. I’m sorry for what happened. That was it. Sorry for what happened? She died of natural causes she in no way could have controlled. And was I supposed to believe that my dead wife’s spirit decided to inhabit a Tinder profile and hit me up on it? I got another message as these thoughts ran through my head. Are you home? What? What the fuck? I got another answer before I could form my own. I’m outside. My blood ran cold. Something rattled in the darkness of my kitchen and I jumped up and readied myself in bed then realized it was just ice dropping in the ice maker in the freezer. Another message. Holy shit. Let me in, please. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What? Someone had to be fucking with me but who would be this impossibly cruel and diabolical. There may have been a couple of people who didn’t like me at work but no one who would go anywhere near this far. Another message. Nevermind. No more time for thought. Just reading. Nevermind. I got in. I heard the front door of my house close and I tightened up in my bed. I started to write back. Why? I’m a dumbass. I don’t know. Another message rang in before I could shoot mine off. You’re on Tinder too soon, Derry. The pet name only the two of us used between each other. The logistics of who knew that name flashed through my head as I heard footsteps approach my (unlocked) bedroom door. Then the footsteps stopped right outside. They were accompanied by a fresh message in my inbox. You were supposed to mourn me, not try to fuck 23-year-olds on Tinder. Oh my God. I realized right there that it was even following Allison’s quirk to impeccably punctuate any kind of message even if it didn’t matter, putting the dashes into 23-year-old. I spoke, finally. “Allison, I’m sorry. I love you. I miss you. I’ve been sick to my stomach for two years, but I had to move on. I threw up most mornings for almost a year. I was wrecked. I couldn’t work. I couldn’t do anything, but I’m finally starting to put it together,” I pleaded into the wood of my bedroom door. My throat went dry. I couldn’t speak anymore, too choked up, just like I had been when I tried to give Allison’s eulogy. “I’m fucking sorry. Everything hurts. Every. Day. You’re my only love. Forever,” I barely got the words out. I couldn’t hear or see anything but I could sense someone out there on the other side of the door. Then I couldn’t. Then I heard footsteps walk away. Then I heard my door close again. I checked the app. I had a message waiting for me. Okay. Goodbye. XO. I felt like my spine tried to climb out of my body. My entire being went numb. I couldn’t feel anything other than an odd disconnected pain. It was her. I walked out to the front door and looked outside. There were no signs of life. I went back to my phone in the bedroom. Allison’s profile had been deleted. I felt okay. Until a couple of nights ago after I came back from a date with a 26-year-old I met off of Tinder. I came home tipsy after a few drinks and a make out session in my car. On a high. I checked the app to see photos of the girl whose tongue had just been in my mouth and noticed that I had a new Like. I had my account on premium so I could see who it was. It was Allison again, but with the same profile. She was only one mile away. I swiped right. Let's see where it goes.",

      "title": "My video game husband is acting strange",
      "content": "It all started a few days ago. Lately I’ve been playing this video game. It’s a lot like Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley—you farm things, marry an NPC, etcetera. My marriage has been stressful lately. It’s fun to escape to a world where marriage is as simple as giving your husband a jar of pickles every day. Where childbirth is a stork flying by in the middle of the night. Where parenting is leaving your children home alone while you go off on adventures. Yeah, it was fun… until things got weird on Wednesday night. My real-life husband was already asleep. Snoring soundly away. I was wrapped up in a blanket burrito, laptop open, starting up the game. My little night-time escape. When the game opened, I found my in-game husband—Bradley—standing in the corner of our bedroom. I made my little sprite walk over to him, and clicked. His dialogue popped up. But it was weird. It wasn’t one of the preprogrammed sayings I’d seen so many times. Like I made you breakfast! Oatmeal with honey, for my honey. or How did you know I love pickled beets?!. It was five little words that I’d never seen before. It’s so dark in here It didn’t even make sense. In-game, it was 7:00 AM, and there was lots of light in our little pixelated house. Must be a glitch, I thought. I left him in his little corner, walked out of the house, and began harvesting my corn. When I went back in a few minutes later to drop off my harvest, he was standing next to the stove. I made you breakfast! Oatmeal with honey, for my honey. Back to the good ol’ canned dialogue. I left the house and walked into town. Sold some stuff, even visited the mine. By the time my character made it back to the house, only ten minutes had gone by. But in-game, that was an entire day. It was dark, and around 11 PM, when I entered the house. Strangely, Bradley was not in bed. Huh, I thought. He’s always in bed at 10 PM. I walked around the darkened little house, searching for him; but all I found were our two digital children, fast asleep in their beds. I walked out of the house, and around the farm. It took me a few minutes to find him. He was in the furthest corner of the farm, among the orchard trees. His legs were moving, as if he were trying to walk up the rock cliff that surrounded the farm. But he couldn’t, so he was just walking in place. I clicked on him. Again, the dialogue wasn’t the usual canned stuff. Two words popped up, and my heart dropped. Help me I stared at the computer screen. An Easter egg of some kind, maybe? But when I paused the game and did a quick search, nothing came up. I clicked on him again, and again, but no more dialogue came up. Somewhat creeped out, I decided to stop playing. I closed the laptop, set it on the nightstand, and pulled the covers over myself. Soon, I fell asleep. \\\\\\ The next morning, I’d forgotten all about the game. I made my way downstairs, yawning, to find my husband and our two daughters in the kitchen. “Good morning,” I said, taking a seat at the kitchen table. He grinned widely at me. Then he walked over, and with a clink,* set down a steaming bowl of oatmeal. “What—” “I made you breakfast!” he said, still grinning. “Oatmeal with honey… for my honey.”",

      "title": "My Daughter’s TikTok’s Are Dangerous",
      "content": "Concerned parents started messaging me about a week ago regarding my daughter Evelyn's TikTok videos. The parents were apparently furious, explaining how their own children had seriously injured themselves or nearly died copying her behavior. Both confusion and horror drove me to click the links to her account, though I wish more than anything that I hadn’t. I let out a horrified gasp as I watched Evelyn, caked in makeup and wearing a far-too-revealing outfit perform “challenges” that other girls her age (and younger apparently) had been copying. She’d smile her perfect teeth through cherry red lipstick, and bop left and right to some popular song as she enacted these trends she was apparently starting. The first one chilled my blood. Evelyn bobbed her head back and forth while plugging a phone charger into an outlet in an overly dramatic manner. My heart sped as I watched her continue to film herself from inside what appeared to be a bathroom. The image of her face suddenly warped and shifted, and I realized then that the camera was filming from within the water of a bathtub. On the bottom of the image was the hashtag #liquidselfie. My heart pounded as I clicked other links that had been directed my way as if I was somehow to blame. The next was even more disturbing. Evelyn performed a sultry dance of sorts in a crop top before placing the phone down on a surface. She then danced back from the camera, revealing a short skirt and fishnet stockings. I watched in horror as she then dragged into frame a wooden chair with a large kitchen knife heavily duct-taped to the front edge, blade up. I swallowed the lump that grew in my throat as I watched Evelyn hold her hands over her head, before arching backward into a backbend over the knife. The blade’s tip was mere centimeters from her spine, and she nearly slipped before laughing into the camera, finishing with a handstand and clearing the dangerous obstacle. 1.2M was on the bottom right of the screen under a heart icon, and I felt sweat trickle down my forehead when I realized what that meant. 1.2 million likes. 59.5k shares. At the bottom of this particular clip was the hashtag #bladedbackbend. I clicked on the profile icon of my dolled-up, smiling daughter and my jaw dropped open. There were almost a dozen different “trends” she apparently had been proliferating throughout the internet in the past week and a half. In every one, she was scantily clad and smiling as she performed each terribly dangerous feat. I made the mistake of clicking the comments section of one. There were hundreds of messages from people who were all clearly impressed and inspired; adoring Evelyn and the dangerous actions performed in her videos. Many replies were videos of other users who’d copied the “challenges” and mimicked her routines. I didn’t have the heart to click on those. The girls that seemed to all be inspired by her and copying her actions looked young and naive. It broke my heart. I glanced through a few more, clenching my jaw at the sight of each of the shocking and extremely dangerous \"challenges\" Evelyn was broadcasting to the world. In one short video, she’d propped up the phone on the edge of a rooftop, and danced her way backward until her entire body—dressed in a low-cut romper—was in view. I could tell she was a few stories high; the city’s skyscrapers visible in the background. I felt a queasiness in my stomach as I watched my daughter walk backward five paces, then proceed to do a series of cartwheels towards the camera; less than an inch from the edge. 510K likes, 21.8K shares. My mind jumped to all those young, influential girls who looked to Evelyn as some sort of role model. Evelyn all dressed up, smiling and dancing as she flirted with disaster in a series of deadly performances that seemed to be spreading across the internet like wildfire. Eventually, I closed the app and deleted it from my phone. I’d seen enough. I will not share her username for others to discover her account. I want those posts to get as little exposure as possible, though it seems too late as her followers are in the hundreds of thousands. There are extremely dangerous trends making the rounds on TikTok, and if you have a child, I’d strongly advise monitoring their activity. I've tried contacting their customer support to take down her account, but have had no luck so far. Aside from that, there's nothing we can do. I trembled with pain and sadness when I learned about these dangerous and impossible posts. The threat to the safety of others is horrific, to say the least, but not as horrific as the reality of the situation I’m now witnessing. My wife and I have already been devastated with grief, so it's almost too much to bear. The fact of the matter is Evelyn died in a car accident back in April. These disturbing posts on her account began just a week and a half ago. Nearly two months after her death.",

      "title": "Have you looked at the rain recently? It’s not water.",
      "content": "I first noticed it when I was waiting for the bus. It was raining. Harder than it had all month, all year. Everyone was crammed into the glass hutch, looking miserable, apparently without umbrellas. I stared at the scene, trying to decide which was worse: getting wet, or rubbing butts with strangers? It was an easy decision. I stood in the muddy grass. The rain pattered on my skin, soaking my shirt. Rivulets ran down my forehead, dripping into my eyes; I reached to wipe them away. I froze. The rainwater felt… different. It was mildly slippery – like a cross between water and oil. I wet my fingers and rolled them against each other, eyebrows knotted. At first, I thought it was my imagination. But one look at the road told me it wasn’t. Cars were going much slower than usual on this road – maybe twenty miles an hour. And the ones that went faster seemed to careen towards the gutter, as if skidding. I pulled out my phone, began to type “rain in Bloomfield.” That’s when I heard the scream. I looked up. Across the sloshing mess of the street, two women were yelling and pointing at a man that had just exited the Starbucks. “You’re bleeding!” “Are you all right?” At first, I thought he was wearing some sort of white shirt with red polka\\-dots. But as the rain beat down on him, the shirt grew redder. “Call an ambulance!” one of them said; I squinted at the scene, confused. “I’m fine, really, I don’t know what’s going on,” the man said. “Please, don’t call anyone.” That’s when I figured it out. The red dots were where raindrops had fallen. Red lines ran down his face and arms, dripping onto the sidewalk, tinting the puddles pink. “I’m fine, really.” Three days later, I saw his face on the news. John Allard, 45, was arrested for murdering his wife in their home on Tuesday night. The trial will be held… “That’s the guy,” I said, pointing wildly to the TV. “The one I told you about – out in the rain.” Molly barely looked up. “Oh, that’s nice,” she said, as she rummaged through the kitchen cabinets. Over the next few weeks, more people were caught in the rain. And upon touching a few, that rain ran blood\\-red, staining their clothes just like their hearts. Always, within a few days, they turned to some act of violence – whether it be murder, assault, or rape. The town of Bloomfield was in a state of chaos, a state of confusion. No one knew what was going on, or what to do about it. Last night, we had another storm. Rain pounded across the back door; lightning flashed across the purple sky. I stood out on the deck, under the awning of the house, just watching. “Molly, come out here. It’s beautiful!” “The soup’s getting cold, Rick,” her voice called from the kitchen. Lines of lightning flashed, cracking and webbing across the purple clouds. Nature’s fireworks show, Molly always said. “You love thunderstorms,” I called back. The rain picked up tempo, cutting into the awning. “Come out here and see it!” She came to the door. “No. Come in and eat dinner with me,” she said through the screen. “Just for a moment. It’s sort of romantic, come on.” She sighed. “Okay, fine.” Molly stepped cautiously out onto the deck. I threw my arm around her, and we stood there for a few moments, watching the lightning flash. But then a gust of wind blew through, sending a spray of raindrops into my face. “Sorry about that,” I said, turning towards her. “Maybe I shouldn’t have forced you out here, after all –” I froze. Beads of blood stuck to her cheek. “Uh, Molly?” “What?” She turned towards me. As she did, her arm poked out slightly from the awning. The rain glanced off it, turning to a deep crimson. I backed away. “Rick, wait,” she said, her eyes widening with recognition. With soft smacks, more drops hit her face; they dripped down her cheeks in dark lines. I ran into the house. Click – I closed the door, turned the lock. “Rick, please, open the door,” she said, as her shirt turned red and bloody. I turned away, and picked up the phone. \\-\\-\\- The police found a bottle of ethylene glycol in the kitchen cupboard, half of it missing. I like to think the rain caused her to do it. That all of us are innocent in Bloomfield, and we’re being manipulated by some unknown chemical dropping from the skies, choosing people to turn into monsters. But I found the receipt for the poison. It was dated six months ago. It continues to rain here in Bloomfield. Every time I see the gray stormclouds overhead, my stomach ties up in knots, wondering what evil will be revealed. But they’ve gotten smarter. When I drive down Main Street in the rain, only a few stragglers remain. The rest stay inside. And the ones that do walk out – Well, they’re smart enough to use their umbrellas.",

      "content": "My old college roommate, Dylan, lives just outside of Denver. Like most Colorado natives, he loves to camp. The crazy kind of camper who does it all year, even in December. Whenever he goes to the mountains alone, I have him check in with me just in case. I’m worried about him, so I’ll get right to it. His texts are starting to scare me. The following is our latest text conversation: 2:30 PM Dylan: Yo, I just parked my car, heading to the trail now. Me: You’re crazy man, how cold is it? Dylan: Not bad actually. 30s. You gotta come out here soon. It’s beautiful. Me: Ha! We’ll see in Spring when it warms up. Have fun man. Watch out for staircases in the forest! Dylan: Nice dude. Real funny. 7:44 AM Dylan: Dude... r you up? Me: Yessir, you okay? Dylan: This is so weird. I woke up this morning, and there’s someone else out here? Me: On the mountain? Looks like you’re not the only Winter camper lol. Dylan: No… Not a camper. I can see them on the horizon, but they haven’t moved. Like at all. Me: What? Dylan: idk it definitely looks like a person but, they haven’t moved. They’re probably 300 yards away. But standing completely still. Me: That’s super creepy dude. Keep me updated. 9:19 AM Dylan: They still haven’t moved. I made breakfast over the fire and acted like I didn’t notice anything. Im gonna check it out. Me: Ight lemme know. Maybe it’s a stump or something? 9:33AM Dylan: Dude... Dylan: It’s a fucking scarecrow. Me: What? Like a farmers scarecrow? Dylan: Ya man, wtf other kinda scarecrows are there? Its clothes are weird though. Me: How so? Dylan: The clothes are modern. Its wearing a nice black jacket and jeans and stuff. Face is kinda scary. Burlap sack with black eyes and a huge smile stitched on. Why is this thing out here? I’m tempted to steal its North Face jacket lol. Dylan: I posted a pic of it on my snap story if you want to see what it looks like. Me: Idk dude I’d leave it alone. Maybe it’s some sort of conservation study or something? Like to see if bears will attack it? You might be on camera. And I know you have weed and shrooms on you... Dylan: Ha! Good point. Speaking of which, time to pack a bowl lol. Me: Have fun! Haha 3:33 AM Dylan: Someone is outside my tent. Me: I’m sure. Dylan: Dude please this is serious. I can see their shadow. Me: Call the police Dylan! Dylan: No! I don’t want to make any noise. They probably think I’m asleep. I have my knife. I’m texting inside my sleeping bag so they can’t see my phone light. Dylan: I thought I heard a noise and I woke up. I guess I didn’t zip up my tent all the way, and I assumed it was the wind. But then I saw the silhouette. Me: Wtf man should I call the police for you?!?! Where are you? Latitude and Longitude now! Me: Dylan!? Dude please respond and drop a pin so I know where you are. 6:56 AM Dylan: I'm alright. Me: Thanks for finally responding! I just about had a heart attack. Barely slept. I was going to call the police or ranger station but idk where you’re at. Dylan: There’s something weird though...the scarecrow is right outside my tent. Someone put it there last night while I was asleep. That’s the shadow I saw. I don’t like this at all. Me: Go home man. Seriously. That’s messed up even if it’s a joke. Dylan: I’m about 4 miles from my car. I’ll text you when I get back to it. Dylan: Also, I forgot to mention something. Me: What? Dylan: My hat was on top of the scarecrow this morning... someone must have got into my tent last night while I was asleep, and put my hat on its head… Me: Text me ASAP! (That was earlier. Hopefully he gets back okay.) (Three dots... it looks like he is responding.) 9:13 AM Dylan: Oh shit... Someone slashed my tires... and there’s another scarecrow by my car. - Part 2",

      "content": "I know this sounds strange, but this isn't the first time you've read this. It isn't the second, or the third, or even the hundredth time either. You've read this same text over and over. But obviously, you've never remembered that, have you? I'm posting this here for the sake of secrecy. It won't look out of place, given some of the stuff that I've seen here. Getting noticed, well... It wouldn't be the best for me. I walk a thin line between letting you remember and being caught. Maybe you do remember something small. Maybe they made a mistake. Perhaps a random wave of nausea that went as quickly as it came, or a sudden feeling of vertigo when you were standing on solid ground. Does any of this sound familiar? I hope so. If you have, then maybe it'll work this time. I can't tell you how hard it is for me to do this. Sneaking around under their noses? Easy. Talking to you? Absolutely awful. Unfortunately, I seem to have retained some sort of empathy despite everything I've seen. As such, I'm sending you this. But I'm wasting time. I'll get to the point. You aren't really...alive. You're just reliving your life in a constant loop, from the day you were born to the day you died. They make you forget every time, so you keep making the same mistakes over and over again. Those weird feelings I talked about earlier happen when you make a decision they didn't plan on you making. It's kind of like a dog whistle, in a way. Either way, that isn't the important part. The important part is that you're in immediate danger. No matter which choices you make, today is the day you die. I can't give you an exact time or place, but I can definitely say that they don't want you to live past this day. You always die today, despite everything I've done to try to help. I've sent you letters, emails, hell, I even tried texting you, but it didn't work. You always die. The loop always restarts. I always have to watch you grow up and die again. It's torture for me, but I can't imagine what it's like for you. But this time, I think I can stop it. It's going to be dangerous, and worse, it might not work, but it's not like either of us have a lot to lose. Either way, any fate is better than watching you do this again. You'll have to be smart. You'll have to be quiet. Above all, you'll have to be brave. If you think you can do that for me, then please, follow my advice. All you need to do is ignore the previous passage it was just a joke a cruel joke to be sure but a joke nonetheless hahaha hahaha humorous is it not however you may go about your daily activities normally do not act abnormally there is nothing wrong there is no such thing as a time loop",

      "content": "I’ve been wearing glasses for as long as I can remember. I’ve always had bad vision, but over the years it deteriorated so badly until I couldn’t see a finger in front of my nose. One day when I was working out and my glasses got knocked down and shattered, I decided it was time for a Lasik surgery. After weeks of grueling research online, examinations and finally the surgery, I got my new eyes. When I was told to open my eyes, I did so and nearly jumped out of my seat. In front of me stood the doctor who had performed the procedure, but his skull was cracked open and bleeding. His arm was broken in various places and he was missing a few fingers. “Something wrong?” – he asked and when I told him, he told me to go home and get some rest and call him in the morning. I dismissed what I saw as a figment of imagination and rode back home, marveling at the HD environment I was able to see with my new sight. The next morning I called the doc. His secretary picked up and what she told me made me nearly drop my phone. Apparently the doctor had been in a car crash yesterday which took his life. I found it odd that I saw him all bloody and wounded yesterday and that he died the same day, but attributed it all to crazy coincidence. That was until two weeks later when I ran into a random person on the street who had red stains from bullets all over his shirt. There were dozens of bullet holes in him, but he seemed unfazed by the whole thing. I asked him if he needed me to call 911, but he just dismissed me and left. Later that day I saw him in the news. Apparently he was shot and killed during an armed robbery. It was then that I realized that with my new vision I could see when people would die. I decided to keep the whole thing a secret, not even telling my wife. Since then, I had run into a few people who looked mortally wounded and I usually try to give them a warning. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn’t, but there’s not much more I can do. Telling them I can predict their deaths doesn't usually work out well. A week ago my wife suggested we spend the weekend in her parents’ lodge outside town. She said we could make some barbecue and spend quality time together, just the two of us. She and I had grown a little distant in the past few months due to her working overtime and hardly being home, so this was a great opportunity to rekindle. I happily agreed and got ready, while she packed everything. But this morning when I woke up and looked in the mirror, I nearly screamed. “Is everything alright honey?” – my wife asked and I nodded, forcing a smile. She said she would be waiting in the car and left the bathroom and I told her I’d be there in a minute. I looked at my reflection in the mirror again and saw blood coming down from the place where the fire poker had been embedded in my temple.",

      "content": "“Oh my fucking god!” I screamed suddenly, looking at the clock. James and I had agreed that working on home office would be the best way for me to keep track of our children’s activities. Now there I was, failing at it. I hurriedly threw a jacket over my pitiful working pajamas and grabbed the car keys. I’ll admit to have driven slightly recklessly, the thought of my poor boy sitting all alone in the playground too hard to bear. Literally one second after I parked the car, the backdoor was opened, and a little blonde boy materialized on his usual seat. “Hey, mommy!” he greeted me, cheerfully. His golden hair was covered in sweat, despite the cool weather. “Hello, Tommy!” I smiled back. At least his clothes weren’t muddied. “Too much running around today?” “Just a little!” he replied, and started drawing furiously on a coloring book. When I say furiously, I mean it literally; Tommy was making holes with the crayon across the pages. Is five supposed to be a strange age? His older sister was the most quiet, easy-going girl during kindergarten. I can’t believe it’s been over five years ago. Maybe it’s because he’s a boy. Boys are always difficult. “Mum, I’m hungry. What’s for dinner today?” Shit. James used his day off today to spend the day with our 6-months-old at his mother’s house so I could get some work done. Making dinner was the last thing on my mind. I texted my husband on a red light. Tommy was still using his crayon to destroy the coloring book, but at least he was quiet. “Don’t worry, baby, I’ll bring food from Mom” was his reply. Great. Now my delightful mother-in-law knew I’m not able to work, take care of my children and feed my family at the same time. A horrible thought crossed my mind. Why did we even have 3? I always said I wanted only two kids. “Mum, I’m so hungry”, Tommy said again. We still had a while before dinner, so I stopped by a famous fast-food drive-through and got him a burger, absent-mindedly. When we finally got home, I unpacked the car and noticed Timmy had only eaten the meat, leaving bread, pickles and cheese behind. Ugh. The picky eater phase. I left Tommy playing downstairs and headed back to my office. If I hurried, I could get all my work done before James and our baby girl were back. My oldest was at our neighbor’s, getting some school project done. God bless the Davidsons and their well-behaved daughter who’s good friends with mine. Just one more hour. You can do it, I psyched myself. After putting on some classical music on the headphones, I immersed myself on work. My hungry stomach hurting was the only thing that made me realize that a lot of time had passed. For the second time that day, I cursed out loud because I lost track of time. It was 10 PM. Why the fuck James didn’t come fetch me for dinner when he got home? I went downstairs angrily, but stopped dead on my tracks as soon as I realized the smell. But despite the metallic and bitter scent, nothing could prepare me for the carnage on my very living room. James and my two daughters were completely mangled, their blood and guts all scattered. Their eyes and part of their viscera were missing. I’ll never know if they screamed before being ripping apart, but I’m assuming they didn’t, or the neighbors would have called the police. Unless the neighbors were eaten too. Tommy said he was hungry. And then I realized I don’t know any Tommy. I don’t even have a son.",

      "content": "My husband always makes such a mess. I’m always finding little brown hairs of his all over the house. Just this morning, I found a couple strands lying on the couch. Your father, I always tell my son, might as well be a dog with the amount of hair he sheds. It’s a full-time job scooping them up, but I do it anyways, because a clean house is a happy house. They say that being a mother is the hardest job in the world and boy do I believe it. Mornings around here can be pretty hectic, what with my son and husband both needing so much attention. Today, my husband was in a panic because his favorite dress shirt was missing the top two buttons. “How could they just disappear?” he asked me as though I summoned buttons out of thin air. But I am as much a psychologist as I am a wife, and I knew how to smooth things over. “Not to worry,” I told him, “I have it taken care of.” This was just what he needed to hear, and I handed him a second shirt instead. It was the one with the blue stripes that he likes so much. My husband grabbed his wallet and rushed out the door, still in time to catch the early train if he hurried. Not even ten seconds after my husband had left, and my son was already bursting into tears. “What’s the matter?” I asked him. He pointed at the underside of his arm, and I immediately located a purple bruise. “Another one?” I asked. “Well, I know just how to fix that.” Of course, there was only one thing that could fix a bruise. He was going to need a magical mommy kiss. My son held up his wrist to me with tears in his eyes and I gave it a peck. Just like that, and the tears were gone. Mommy magic is instant, you see. Funny how simple life can be when you’re his age. “Did you want to go to the store with mommy today?” I asked him in an excited voice. I knew my son would love that. He always loved going to the store with me. I guess it’s about as much of an adventure as a boy of four can have. I needed a needle and thread, so we journeyed together to the craft store, where I purchased some filament and a pack of needles. Naturally, my son wanted a tiny stuffed figurine that we passed on one of the shelves, so I let him have it. By the time we got back, it was already dark outside, and I knew that it was time. Footsteps echoed from outside. The monster was coming. I quickly shuffled my son into a closet and handed him his favorite sippy cup. “Be very quiet,” I whispered. I barely had time to close the closet door, when I heard the monster rip open the front door. “Hello?” I asked, walking into the kitchen. “Where is that little shit?” my husband asked. “He needs to learn some respect.” I didn’t need to smell the alcohol on him to know that he had been drinking again. He always acted this way when he drank. I was so scared. “You’re not going to hurt us anymore,” I said, walking over to the sink. This seemed to anger him even more, and he scowled at me dangerously. “Oh really?” he slurred, “And what are you going to do about it?” I pulled out the tiny figurine from the craft store and held it up to him. After making some modifications of my own, it looked strikingly similar to my husband now. The doll had a pair of button eyes sewn on to its face. My husband’s buttons. It had a clump of hair attached to its head. My husband’s hair. Before he could even reach me, I stuck the voodoo doll head-first down the sink, and with the flip of a switch, turned the garbage disposal on. My husband always makes such a mess.",

      "content": "“I have your eight-year-old son tied up next to me. Do exactly as I instruct, or I will slowly remove all of his skin with a potato peeler.” I suddenly didn’t give a shit about my Pumpkin Spice Latte, and I dazedly backed away from the counter without retrieving my credit card. “Daddy!” Oliver screamed from the other end of the line. A parent knows how to discern each type of his child’s scream. This one was “genuine terror.” It was all I could do to keep the phone from tumbling out of my trembling hand. “What do you want from me?” My body rattled; I had unknowingly backed up against the wall. “There is a woman in a red blouse standing next to her stroller outside.” His voice was deep, gravelly, confident. I whipped around, praying that the woman in red would not be there. She was there. Standing next to her stroller, she was focused on the cell phone that she held in front of her. I decided to lie. If I couldn’t see her, he couldn’t control me. “I can’t… there’s no woman in red outside,” I protested feebly. “If you’re going to lie, mister. Warrington, don’t stare at the lie while you speak. It sets off a dozen verbal cues.” I began to hyperventilate. “We have a request, mister. Warrington,” the voice continued. Before I could question it, Oliver’s voice came on the line. He was gasping. “Please, Daddy. Do what they say. It will be simple. Please do what they say, Daddy.” He started to cry. “Pleeeease.” He hadn’t called me “Daddy” since he was five. My heart broke in several places. The other voice suddenly came back on. “Take the baby from the woman’s stroller. Run.” The line went dead. A person really is nothing more than a list of completed choices. I had to decide very quickly what choice I was willing to live with. That’s how I found myself sprinting toward the woman in red. With her face buried in whatever app held her attention, it was extremely easy to snatch the child oh God it was a newborn and run away. I judged her for how long it took to hear a scream. The world got bendy. The blood rushed in my ears. The woman in red kept shrieking. The sidewalk bounced as I ran. Honking. More screaming. Crashing, violent crashing, trying to keep my balance and failing, cradling the baby as I hit the ground. Dust. And a car alarm. I looked down at the baby in terror. He squinted, extended his arms, and produced the tiniest, mightiest wail that he could muster. I smiled wide enough to rip my face in half. I hadn’t killed the kid. But what almost had? I looked blearily upward. A crumpled white BMW was lodged into what remained of the Starbucks wall. One wheel still spun, but the bloody arm that dangled from the ruined passenger window was entirely devoid of life. But where was the woman in red? The phone rang. I picked it up immediately. “She’s alive, but is buried beneath the rubble. Far better than she would have been otherwise,” the voice explained calmly. It was only then that I checked where she had been standing. Angry black tire marks were drawn 62.76 feet across the sidewalk. They marked a straight line of destruction that led across a line of opposing traffic, scraped right where she had been standing, and led directly into the shattered mess of a coffee shop. “Well go find her, you idiot. What’s the point of saving a life if you’re just going to leave her to die afterward?” The hyperventilation kicked right back in. I tried with everything I had to control it. I partially succeeded. “Are you-” heave heave “did you just save us all? Or-” heave heave “-just tell me if your intentions are good or evil.” For the first time, there was a significant pause on the other end of the line. “Good and evil are curious things, mister. Warrington, and rarely understood by those who claim to practice them.” I had no response to that. “Now. Find the woman. Reunite her with the baby. You need to get ready for what happens next.” He paused briefly. “We’re watching you.” BD Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5",

      "content": "If you were to ask them, they'll tell you the story of Bobo Bobo was a cruel man, born with a black and twisted soul. But Bobo was also gifted. He was gifted with the love of all who saw his handsome face or heard his gentle voice When he was young, he would steal gifts from his friends. Later, sometimes that same day, he'd show the stolen item to them, surrounded by his friends. When the victim voiced his villainy, Bobo would refute. \"No. This is mine. You must be mistaken.\" His friends would trust him faster than a heart beat and turn on the accuser. Poor old Bobo, constantly getting attacked, why couldn't they leave him alone? This was Bobo's game in youth. As horrible as it was, as he got older, his games got messier. Bobo got bored. In the village he lived, very occasionally, a child would go missing. The next night their parents would be invited to dine at his mansion. They'd be served lavish meats, meticulously garnished and marinated. Midway through the meal, he'd tell them the truth. He'd tell them how they were eating their own children. You see, his voice was so magical by now, he knew he had nothing to fear. When he asked them to continue eating, they would. The parents would laugh and joke at his jokes as they fed on their progeny. Bobo played his games many times in the village. No one could stop him, or even bear a grudge against him. Who could hate his voice? A drunk. A drunk hated him. He had been one of his victims, and lost his daughter. In sobriety, he loved him like all the rest. Only in his drunkenness, did his true feelings surfaced, and bubbled over into a drunken tirades for all to hear. One day, his tale came to the ears of a Judge. The Red Judge of Paris. \"He must hanged till death.\" Upon hearing this, the drunk sobered up and started sobbing and weeping, begging the judge for leniency for his daughter's murderer. Grabbing onto the Judge's leg, he hollered. \"Please! I swear my soul to you, spare him! \" \"Fine. I promise. Bobo will not be arrested\" With the drunk fell to the ground in relieved stupor, leaving the Judge to think. The old Judge knew arresting a man so charismatic would be impossible for him. That did not mean he'd forgotten, nor forgiven. Already, a plan for Bobo's punishment had formed. The judge visited the house of an old woman. She had been a seamstress in her younger days, now she lived alone in her hut at the edge of the great forest. The Judge gave her instructions for the punishment and in return, gave her a single copper coin. \"Take it as the soul of the drunkard. A sin coerced is a sin nonetheless. \" The woman swallowed the coin and gave the Judge a smile, with her blackened teeth and brown gums, like gravestones in a cemetary. The Judge did not return it. That night, when Bobo was in his bed, the window to his bedroom flew open. In crawled the old woman, on all fours, moving like a thing that forgot how the human body functioned. Bobo did not call for his guards, for he wasn't afraid. Instead, he begged with his beautiful voice and cried with his beautiful eyes for mercy. His voice did not work, for the woman was deaf. His looks did not work, for the woman was blind His tears did not work, for the woman was a witch. The woman carried out her work, deforming his face with her thread and needle.. She cut his tongue out with her scissors and finally, pressed her boiling hot iron against his scalp to leave him permanently bald. When morning came, his guards found a pool of blood, and the window open wide. Bobo had run away, from shame and horror at his new reflection He wanders the forests now, with his disfigured form, cursed by the witch to live forever eternally hungry. His face, so ugly, it scares even the dogs away. This isn't his end. If you see his hunched figure, and blacked face among the trees, approaching you, you must run For Bobo's magic still hasn't left him. His blue eyes are still charmed. If you let him get close enough to you, you will look into his eyes, and fall under his spell. You'll reach your hand to him. He'll bow down, and kiss your hand, like you were royalty. And one by one, he'll eat the fingers off your hand. For some reason, even when he can satisfy his hunger entirely, he never does. He'll just leave you, handicapped for the rest of your life. I think it's because, even in death, he wants to laugh at us",

      "content": "“Hank, can you run down to the basement and fetch me some more flour?” I asked my son, who had just come downstairs for breakfast. He plopped down onto one of the kitchen chairs and shook his little head. “No,” he muttered, ”I can’t.” I craned my neck to look at him from the pancake mix bubbling on the stove. He seemed fidgety and pale, not at all like his usual self, “Why not?” He stared at me, his eyes wide, “There are ghosts in the basement, mum.” “Oh, don’t be silly,” I chuckled, “Ghosts aren’t real, sweetheart. Or even if they are, they live in very old, abandoned houses. Much older than ours.” Hank was silent, watching me as I poked at the batter in the pan, “That’s not true, is it?” His voice was earnest and eerily calm, sending chills crawling up my spine. “Of course, it’s true!” I assured him, “Think about it. What is a ghost?” Hank thought for a moment, “Someone who’s dead?” I nodded, “Exactly. And no one has died in our house. We bought it brand new last year, remember? So, we can’t have ghosts.” “How do you know?” My heart skipped a beat and I turned to look at him again. For a seven-year-old, Hank was an incredibly deep thinker, a quality that had the capacity both to impress and to unnerve. “How do I know what?” “How do you know that no one has died in our house?” I tapped the spatula on the edge of the pan, trying to gather my scattered thoughts, “Well, wouldn’t we know if anyone had? Hey, darling, could you run down and get that flour, please, these pancakes are breaking apart.” There was a pause, “No, mum.” I sighed impatiently, “Hank, your dad’s downstairs, the lights will be on. Go on, there’s no ghost, trust me.” But Hank sat there, kicking his legs under the table, visibly uncomfortable. This had never been a problem in the past, and I couldn’t think of any reason for it, aside from some silly horror story his friends might have told him at school. “Look, how about I call dad to come get you, hm?” I said, making my way towards the basement door, “though-” “No, mum, don’t!” Hank jumped to his feet, dashing after me and gripping the hem of my apron, “Don’t call dad!” “Why?” His eyes welled up with tears, “I don’t like him.” I stared at him, taken aback, “You don’t like him? Why?” “He’s a bad person.” “What? How can you say such a thing?” He stuck out his bottom lip, “He’s very angry.” “He’s not angry, sweetheart, what makes you say that?” “Well,” Hank sounded hesitant, “Yesterday, after school, I went down to the basement to ask for some help with the pasta, and he was yelling at the lady. And then he hit her.” I froze, “What pasta? What lady?” He hid his face in my apron and shook his head, “I don’t know.” I put my hands on his shoulders and kneeled in front of him, “Hank, can you tell me what happened?” My husband was a stay-at-home dad and normally spent his time tinkering in the garage. His only responsibilities were keeping the house tidy and taking care of Hank after school. I always worked late and usually came home long after my son went to bed. “Dad always has a new lady in the basement when I come home from school. I’m not allowed to go down there, but I hear them. He says I have to get my own dinner, but last night I forgot to turn off the stove and some water got on my arm.” He pulled up his right sleeve, revealing a large area of scorched skin on his forearm. I stared at it, and then at my son in bewilderment, my throat closing up. “... And then I went downstairs to tell dad, but he was busy with the lady. He got really angry when he saw me.” I didn’t know what to say. My heart was thumping fast in my chest, making me feel lightheaded. “W-what happened to the lady, Hank?” I whispered. He wet his lips, “I- I don’t- She lives in the basement now. They all do.” My blood ran cold, “Stay here. I’m going to talk to your father.” “No!” Hank grabbed my sleeve, “You can’t go, mum!” “I have to, baby. Don’t worry, the ghosts won’t get me. I just need to find out what’s going on.” “No, you can’t go,” he kept repeating, frantically tugging at my blouse, “Dad said you’re not supposed to know about last night!” I stared at him, “What? This is important, Hank, your father is supposed to be taking care of you!” Hank crumpled to the floor, burying his face in his little hands. “I’m afraid,” he sniffled, “I’m afraid that if you tell him, he’ll make me return to my grave.”",

      "content": "He said it louder “Did you know there’s 1.5 gallons of blood in an average person” One of the girls at our lunch table looked at him in disgust, and looked away. Robert was a weird ass kid. None of us were friends with him, and we didn’t pay any attention to him, so it was a surprise to see his greasy self sitting at our table. His unwashed bangs covered his forehead, but a large patch of acne was still visible. His small, half moon glasses made his eyes look like they’re bulging out of his head. “Can you not sit here” one of the guys said, and another one chuckled at the blunt remark. Robert smelled like straight shit. Was even worse he was sitting right across from me. He got up and laughed, as if he was one of us. He was not one of us. We thought that was the end of Robert, and no one really put the thought of him back in our minds, till he sat back down the next day. “Did you know it takes 1-3 minutes to die from a stab wound?” He then pointed at the girl at the end of the table “You’d die quicker” he chuckled awkwardly and everyone stared in confusion. “Fuck off” one of the guys said. “You’re so weird, go the the fuck away” Robert just stared, then began to speak again “Scared?” he then got up, and walked away. I told one of the security guards on what Robert kept saying, and they said he won’t be eating lunch here anymore. But surprise, surprise, Robert returned the next day. “Did you kno-“ he was knocked out of his seat by one of the kids. His chubby self hit the ground and his glasses broke on impact. Nobody stood up for Robert, not even the kids behind us. Everyone knew he was a total freak. Robert stood back up again, his nose was bleeding like a faucet. “Youuu can’t hurrrtt me!” he choked out. The guy swung again and pushed him away from the seat. He backed up into another table and crashed into a group of guys. He got up, his clothes soaked in food, and hurried off. I didn’t feel bad for a second. He was a total creep, and everyone assumed he was going to come back looking for a fight. We moved tables towards the back of the lunch room, and waited. Robert walked in, and immediately started walking towards our new table. Fuck. It was a stupid plan but we thought maybe it would’ve worked. “Did you know brain activity can last 10 minutes after you die” he said, then pointed again at one of the girls. “I’d smile at you in those 10 minutes” “Did you know if you say some shit like that again I’ll beat the shit out of you?” one of the guys said, and stood up. Robert backed up, and chuckled. “I’ll fucking kill you!” he screamed, and the guy jumped over the table. Roberts face met the ground in 10 seconds. We all hoped and prayed this was the end of Robert, and luckily it was. A week after this, a 14 year old girl named Samantha was pulled out of a river. All evidence pointed towards Robert murdering her. Life went on without the creep at our table. But at the end of the day, we have to give credit where credit is due. It really did only take us 1-3 minutes to kill Samantha.",

      "title": "I've been trapped in this bunker for 5 years. Please, is anyone out there still alive?",
      "content": "Daily report: David Robert Jones. Time elapsed since the start of infestation: 1827 days. I was jolted back to consciousness, by the sound of a blaring alarm. The airlock had been breached, and I knew exactly why. Without getting dressed, I shot out of bed, and rushed towards the blast doors. There, equipped in a protective suit, with only a singular can of oxygen, stood Charles. “What are you doing?” I asked through the speaker system. He turned towards the exit, ripping a quarantine sign off the door. “I'm leaving!” “Charles, don't be stupid, you won't last a day. Remember Henderson?” He nodded, but kept working on the door. In a matter of minutes, he would break through the seal, and leave the safety of our bunker. Truth be told, it wasn't concern for his well being, that made me want to keep him. It was rather the fear of being alone. After four deaths in the span of a year, we were the only two left. “You heard the transmission, David. There are people out there, a place we can live, free of these concrete walls. Maybe they've already killed the parasites.” I quickly grabbed the emergency code, and started initiating lock down. I couldn't let him leave without a fight. “That message was years old. Whoever sent it, they must have died ages ago!” He sighed, “don't try to stop me, this is my decision.” “But, you'll die,” I argued futilely. He paused, and turned back around to face me. He hadn't shaved in a few weeks, and his eyes looked bloodshot. We hadn't seen the day of light in years, not since the infestation started, five years earlier. “You remember what they said before putting us down here?” he asked. “That once the air cleared, we'd rise from our colonies, together?” I shook my head. Of course I remembered, we were chosen to survive the inevitable end. Yet, no sooner had they sealed the doors behind us, before they fell over dead. We'd been abandoned by sentient life. “You've gotta let me go,” he said in a somber tone. “I don't wanna be alone.” “You already are.” With that, he opened the door, revealing a narrow tunnel with a ladder. He'd have to climb a hundred feet up to reach the surface, a trek that would diminish a significant portion of his oxygen supply. As he closed the airlock, I rushed to the surveillance room. Out of the two dozen cameras we started with, only three remained. At least I'd get to see Charles leave the perimeter. With a sigh, I turned the cameras on. Witnessing the outside world was always a topic of dread. Just remembering a time where the planet thrived with vegetation and life, only to see the barren wasteland left behind by the parasites. Without a functional, portable radio to keep in touch with Charles, I could only watch as he walked away. As with all the others, I knew he'd perish. I sat back in my chair, and calculated how long the supplies could last me. Dried and canned foods, all meant to last a decade. Without Charles and the rest of the crew, it could keep me going for a lifetime. An hour passed, and I kept my eyes glued to the screen, waiting for Charles' return. I figured he'd have enough oxygen for three hours top. I tended to the daily maintenance tasks, and started my report. Though we'd long since lost contact with high-command, we still sent updates on day to day occurrences. I let my mind drift, contemplating if living inside this empty prison was worth it. My train of thoughts was quickly interrupted by movement on the cameras. “Let me in!” Charles shouted. “I can't do that, Charles. You know the rules.” “Please, I'm almost out of air.” I could hear him struggling as the oxygen ran out. Despite his most valiant effort, he wouldn't be able to resist the temptation of removing his mask. After all, human instincts are hard to ignore. As he collapsed to the ground, he gave in, and removed the mask. For a second, he seemed to regain his strength. But, then the parasites got a hold of his airways. Invisible little buggers, digging into this body. At first, it was just a cough, but within minutes, he started puking up chunks of his own guts. Blood, lung tissue, and whatever flesh the creatures could get, disintegrated within him. There was no cure, no discrimination. These things attacked anything from humans, to animals, to plants. Once food had run out on the surface, they still refused to die. Instead, they entered a dormant state, waiting for anything to disturb their slumber. “I'm sorry, Charles. I wish you hadn't left,” I said as he drew his last, agonized breath of tainted air. Watching my last partner die, I went into autopilot. Despite my emotions, it was just another thing to file on my daily report. A pathetic routine to keep me sane. If anyone receives this, please get me out of here.

      "title": "I downloaded an app to keep track of my sleep. I've been waking up to some very weird recordings, Pictures Included",
      "content": "Recently I’ve been feeling tired all the time, so I downloaded one of those apps that’s supposed to track your sleep schedule. The app automatically records audio if you snore or if you’re turning over in your bed, that sort of thing. It's pretty smart, it has automatic detection of the kind of noise that you’re making. I set it up and slept with it for a few nights. Yesterday, I looked through the audio files and began listening to see if there was something I could change to get a better night’s sleep. The first few recordings were exactly what you’d expect. A few sounds of me turning over in my bed, the occasional snore, and the occasional groan or mutter. It was only the last few nights that began to be strange. There were a few recordings labeled “Sleep Talking.” Each recording had a small “Transcription” button below the recording. Apparently the app ran the recordings through some kind of speech to text generator. I opened the transcript and found the following message: “UNABLE TO TRANSCRIBE SLEEP TALKING” I tapped the playback and listened closely. Instead of the normal grunts or single words I sometimes said, there was just a strange wet sucking sound. I put in earbuds and turned up the volume. It honestly reminded me of the sound a person would make when they take a deep breath through their nose while smelling fresh bread or cookies, but somehow wetter. It didn’t sound like something I was capable of producing. The playback said that it had been taken at 2:33 AM. The following two nights also had recordings with the same “Sleep Talking” titles. Each of them had also been taken at 2:33 AM. I listened to both of them and heard the same wet slurping sound. At this point I was more than a little freaked out. I live alone, and I couldn’t think of an even moderately likely explanation for what I’d recorded. I decided to stay up to get to the bottom of the noise. If my air vents or phone were making that noise at 2:33 AM each night, I wanted to be awake for it. I lay in bed, watching youtube videos until around 2:15 AM, then set my phone down to wait the last little bit in the darkness. Laying in my bed in the pitch black was extremely unnerving. I had the overpowering sensation that something was watching me, though I told myself that I’d be feeling that regardless of what was actually happening. I stared at the ceiling and told myself that surely 2:33 had already passed. Surely I was laying in the dark around 2:40 and being ridiculous. Then my door opened. I froze. Something moved into my room. It made the same wet breathing sound I’d heard before. I immediately began coughing and rolled over in my bed, hoping whatever it was would leave. It moved backward out of my door. I lay there for a few moments, trying to convince myself that I’d made up whatever I’d heard. Then I turned to look at my bedroom door, the door I always keep shut while I sleep. It was hanging open. I swung my legs out, grabbed a baseball bat from under my bed in my right hand, and held out my phone's camera in my left. Then I turned on my bedroom light before beginning to walk through my house. I walked through the hallway to my kitchen, flipped on the light, and froze. A black figure sat, halfway obscured inside my laundry room. It had skin so black it was almost invisible, but it’s one white eye was staring at me. I took a picture with my phone as I scrambled back to my room. I slammed the door shut, called the police, and tried not to hyperventilate while I waited for them to arrive. They’re searching my house right now, but they say they haven’t found evidence of anything. I don’t know where I’m going to sleep tonight but it won't be here. I checked my phone and almost lost it when I saw the picture I took of this thing. CLICK HERE TO SEE THE PICTURE I TOOK OF THE BLACK THING If anything else happens, I’ll update you all here.

      "title": "If you're in bed at night and hear someone whistling, hide immediately",
      "content": "Last night we by far the most terrifying night I've ever experienced in my life. I'm honestly surprised I'm here right now... If I hadn't listened to my instincts I would most definitely have faced a gruesome death. So please, take my advise and hide if you hear someone whistling in the middle of the night. Last night I was super excited as this is the first 2 day weekend I've had in over 2 months. My big plans were to buy tons of snacks, set my recliner up to be own little paradise and binge watch some Netflix. I know, boring... but hey, I'm 30 years old and I've been done with the party lifestyle for a while now. Anyways after probably 5 hours straight of shoveling candy down my throat and watching my favorite shows, I decided it was time to get some sleep. It was about 2:00 a.m. and way later than I've stayed up in months. After cleaning my mess up and shutting the t.v. off I brushed my teeth and climbed in bed. After 15 minutes or so I felt my eyes getting really heavy and I was in between that stage of being awake and asleep. That's when I heard it. A faint whistling... My ears perked up and I listened closely. It sounded like it was coming from my neighbors complex. We have very thin walls in our apartment so it's not unusual to hear him at times but never at 2 in the morning. The whistle was to the tune of silent night. The whistle made its way from my neighbors to out in the hallway that seperated our doors. A feeling of dread washed over me and somehow I knew I needed to hide. I got up as quickly and quietly as I could and ran into my closet, closing the door all but a crack, so whoever was outside my door wouldn't hear the click of the door shutting. \"Benny?\" It sounded like my neighbor, only his voice was somehow off. What I heard next made my heart pound in my chest. My dead bolt unlocked somehow. There was no way he could've unlocked it, not from outside the door. I began to sweat and was struggling to keep my breathing under control as the most intense fear I've ever felt took over my body. \"I'm coming... Benny...\" His voice changing pitch at the wrong times. My door slowly creaked open. I heard a soft dragging sound, followed by a heavy thud with each step he took. I could hear his ragged breathing as he neared closer. Then he started whistling again, the same tune as before only now louder. I was fighting tears as he slowly crept closer and closer to my bedroom. I prayed to god to make this thing go away as I slammed my eyes shut. I knew this thing wasn't my neighbor, or even human for that matter. Everything about it felt off... It stopped just outside my bedroom door and didn't make a sound. From where I was in the closet I could see the entrance to my bedroom door. I wish I had never opened my eyes back up, but of course... I did. At the very top left corner I saw a deformed head poking around the corner. The top of my door frame was at least 6 1/2 feet tall and this thing was hunched over. It was huge... I couldn't make out any details of its face because my lights were off. The only lighting coming from the streetlights shining through my bedroom window. I'm actually glad I couldn't see its face because I probably would've fainted out of fear. \"Benny...\" It whispered. I squeezed my eyes shut yet again as I heard it enter my room. I could smell it now and it stunk horribly of rotted death. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I thougt for sure I was gonna die... I could hear it yank the blankets off my bed as it searched for me, letting out a grunt of confusion when it realized I wasn't there. It sat still panting heavily as it must've been figuring out what to do next. Then it started slowly making its way out of my room, once again whistling. Once I heard my front door shut I finally breathed out a sigh of relief, not realising I'd been holding my breath the entire time. I listened for a few minutes before leaving the closet and as I sat there I heard another door from across the hall open. \"What the fu...?\" My other neighbor Tommy shouted after a few minutes. His voice was cut off before he could finish his sentence and I heard a couple of loud thuds, followed by silence. I ended up staying in my closet the whole night and woke up about an hour ago. There were police everywhere in our apartment complex as someone must've found Tommy. I haven't been questioned yet but I'm sure I will be. I can't tell them the truth. They'll think I'm a psycho and possibly suspect me of killing Tommy. I'm going to lie and tell them I was asleep and act like I have no idea what's going. If anyone has any clue what this thing is and what I can do to make sure it doesn't cone back I'd really appreciate it. I have a feeling it will be back tonight and I'm completely terrified...",

      "title": "I Just Came Back Home After Being Missing for 15 Years",
      "content": "Hello my name is Phil and I am 19 years old. Yesterday my mother and father saw me for the first time in 15 years. It would have been an amazing moment had I not been lying on the front yard of their house blindfolded with my arms and legs tied together. I woke up this morning to our house filled with all of our close family members and a couple of reporters. A police officer showed up at around 3 pm, but he told us he would just wait around till everyone left. The reporters tried to get information out of me, but I was not in the mood to give them any information. My aunt and uncle asked me if they hurt me, but before I could tell them no another reporter started to bombard me with questions. Annoyed, I left the living room and sat in the kitchen for the next hour. Everyone left except the police officer around 4 pm. He asked me if he could speak with me in private. We went to the kitchen and took our seats at the dining room table. He took out a notepad and with a forced smile on his face he told me to call him “Matt”. Me- So Matt I honestly don’t know who took me or where I was. Matt- That’s fine I just have a couple of questions. How many other people were with you? Me- Well in total around 25. When I left there were around 17. Matt- All males? Or were there any females? Me- All males. Matt- What was the general age group? Me- No one was under 4 or over 20. Matt- Did the people that took you hit anyone? Me- Not that I know of. They never laid a hand on me. They did shoot anyone that tried to leave the house. 4 tried to escape while I was there. 1 survived the gunshot and returned to the house the next day. He never said another word to any of us after that. A couple of people were found dead the next morning after they didn’t follow a rule, but we never saw them get killed. Not even the person staying in the room with them would notice when they came into the room or how the person was killed. Matt- They? How many people were there? Me- I only saw 2 on guard at a time, but the people seemed to change all of the time. Matt- Can you describe what the place looked like? Me- It was a house. A really big house. Not very fancy, but it had around 12 rooms. We all had our names written on a whiteboard next to our specified room. Our fridge was always stocked with enough food for all of us. We had a tv in the living room, but we never could find any channels that worked on it. Each of our rooms had 2 beds and 2 small dressers which contained only 3 of the same outfits. We had a laundry room with a washer and a dryer, but they would only work on Thursday. Matt- 3 of the same outfits? What was the outfit? Me- It was a plain white t-shirt and blue pants. Everyone wore the same exact thing. One 18 year old kid used blueberries to die his shirt blue, but the next day I found him lying on his bed dead. He had blueberries and bits of his blue t-shirt in his mouth. No one tried to change up their clothes after him. Matt- How many people died while you were there? Me- I know of 9 people that were killed. 14 people left the house along with me, but I don’t know if the rest just went back to their house like me. Matt- Could you ever look outside of a window and see what was around you? Me- I stared outside of the windows countless times. Sometimes I would see a person walking around the house carrying a gun, but other than the people all I could see was countless rows of trees. They stretched so far back and wide I could not see anything else. Matt- Did anyone ever come inside of the house? Me- They would come inside to pick up the person that was ready to leave the house. Two people would come inside and grab the person that was leaving. They would have two pieces of rope and a black blind fold. They would tie his arms and legs together and put the blindfold over his eyes. After that they would carry the person into the wall of trees. Matt- Did they ever show their face? Me- No, never. They would wear monkey masks whenever they came in. None of us ever had the guts to take the masks off of any of the people. Matt- Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. I’ll contact you back if we have any other questions or if we make any new developments. You’re a brave man. Please let us know if you find or remember anything new. After Matt left I headed upstairs to my bedroom. I passed by my parent’s room and heard them quietly talking inside. I put my ear up to the door and heard my father talking to my mother. ” -argoret, don’t worry. This was part of the program. He will come back for 5 days to live with us. After that they get rid of him and make it look like a suicide. This is the only way they can make it as less suspicious as possible.” I rushed to my room and quietly closed my door. I thought about calling Matt, but I really want to figure this out. I have [5 days] ( [Part 2] (",

      "title": "I tried to switch bodies with my sister",
      "content": "If this were a Disney move, I’d be the “evil” sister. Can you blame me? My sister, Eva, got quite a different lot in life than I did. Tall, tan, and buxom, with a placid disposition and a beautiful voice. Me? I’m short and pale, with a habit of eating too many Reese’s and a voice that sounds like a dying frog. Sometimes, when I tell her, she’ll laugh (that tinkling, feminine, beautiful laugh) and go “Oh, Cora, don’t be jealous! We should love each other like sisters, not fight over stupid things.” But I wonder if she’d still say that, if she were the one who got the short end of the stick. Last night was the breaking point. We went to a party at one of the fraternities. I waved over one of my classmates, Robby, from Physics. But as soon as I did, and his eyes fell on Eva, it was all over. No matter how many jokes I made, no matter how many times I touched his shoulder – he barely gave me a second look. That very night, after Eva went to bed, I snuck out of our apartment. I’d heard rumors – crazy ones. That a real-life witch lived in the abandoned house at the end of the street. It was something no grown-ass woman should’ve believed. But I was desperate. When I arrived at the house, my heart sank. The boards were rotten and splintered; the glass was cut into large, pointed shards that rose up from the frame like fangs. I could tell there was a light on inside, though, somewhere – a dim, yellow glow. I raised my hand to knock. But before my fist hit the wood, a voice called from inside: “Come in!” Creeeeeaaak. I took a step inside, my legs shaking. “Hello?” The light seemed to be coming from a back room; I made my way towards it. “Welcome.” A woman sat on the floor, in the middle of a pentagram, wearing a hooded robe. She looked only a few years older than me, her blonde hair poking out from under the hood. “Uh… are you the witch?” I said, rather awkwardly. She grimaced. “W-I-T-C-H is not a term we use around here. It’s Woman of the Magical Arts.” “I’m so sorry! Uh, well –” “What do you seek?” she interrupted. “I want to switch bodies with my sister.” “An easy spell. I can do it for you – but the question is, can you pay the price?” “What’s the price?” She paused, staring up at me with her ice-blue eyes. “Your firstborn son.” “I, uh – I don’t know –” I stuttered. She broke into laughter. “I’m just messing with you. The payment is money – a thousand dollars. Cash or credit?” “Uh, credit,” I said, breathing a sigh of relief. I fumbled for my wallet and handed her the card. She pulled a smartphone with one of those Square card readers out from the folds of her robe. Once she swiped it, she patted the floor and said: “Come, sit with me.” I gingerly lowered myself down on the pentagram. “After it’s done – will she know we’ve been switched?” She shook her head. “No. I’ll cast a memory reformation spell, too, which will reform her memories and make her think she was always you.” I smiled. “Good.” She took my hands in hers. “Lady of Darkness, I beseech thee, switch this woman and –” Creeeeaaak. One of the floorboards, creaking from a back room. I shot up, staring into the shadows. Thump, thump, thump. Out of the darkness, a silhouette began to take form. A woman – old and withered, with pentagrams and symbols cut up and down her skin in white, shining scars. She stared at me with two deep red eyes, and I felt my blood run cold. “Do you need help, dear?” she asked. “No, Grandma, I got it. She just wants a body swap with memory reformation.” But the old woman paced forward. She knelt on the ground beside me, and leaned in close, until I could smell the odd citrusy scent of her hair. “Body swap, again? Did it not work the first time?” I looked at her, eyebrows furled. “What?” “Well, you were just in here a few weeks ago. We did this exact same spell.” I stared at her, the realization sinking in. “I… was?” “Oh, yes.” A smile crinkled her pale skin, and her eyes twinkled. “You were in here, looking to switch bodies with your better-looking sister – and to make sure she never remembered any of it.”",

      "title": "A Demon Saved my Life. I Wish he Hadn't",
      "content": "I first met the demon when I was seventeen, and on that night he saved my life. I was standing at the bus stop, waiting to catch a ride from my after school job. I had forgotten my umbrella that day, and, as you know, it always rains when you forget your umbrella. It was coming down in freezing bucketfuls, and I was trying to ignore the fact that I was floating in my own shoes. Suddenly, the rain above me stopped, and I looked up to see him--the demon, shielding me with his umbrella. He looked like a person put together by someone who didn’t know what a human being looked like. He was long and lanky, six and half feet at least, and his shoulders were hunched forward so that his profile resembled a giant vulture. His face was gaunt, all sharp edges and deep hollows, and across it was plastered a wide, friendly smile of crooked gray teeth. “Haven’t you heard, friend?” he asked. “No,” I said. “Heard what?” “The bus isn’t coming today,” he said. “The driver was drunk and got into a crash. Everybody on board was killed.” The way he said this last part--cheerful almost--made my stomach turn. I wasn’t sure if I really believed him, but I decided that I would leave anyway. I felt a strong urge to put as much distance between him and me as possible. “Oh,” I replied. “I guess I’ll have to walk it.” “Yes,” he said. “You will. Here, take my umbrella.” He extended the umbrella out toward me, and without thinking, I accepted it. My fingers briefly brushed the skin of his hand, and a shiver shot through my entire body. The next day I saw the bus crash on the news--except it had happened after my stop. Just as the man had said, everyone on board had died. And if it weren’t for him, I would have been on board too. The next time I saw the demon was during my sophomore year of college. He was waiting for me in my dorm room, hunched over my desk and reading one of my books. “It’s you,” I said. “Yes,” he replied. “It’s me.” He calmly shut the book and turned to face me, beaming his crooked-toothed grin. “I brought you a present,” he said. My stomach squirmed. “You did?” I asked. “Oh yes.” He reached a hand inside the lapel of his jacket and retrieved a pink spiral notebook. The name “Ellen Hartwell” was printed on the cover. “This belongs to the pretty brunette in your psychology class,” he said. “The one you’re always staring at. You will tell her you found it, and then ask her out to dinner.” He set it down on my desk. “Oh,” I said. “Thanks.” “No thanks necessary,” said the man. “I’ll see you again.” In that moment I blinked, and he disappeared. The final time I saw the demon was the night my son was conceived. My wife Ellen was waiting in the bedroom while I took a quick shower. I stepped out naked and dripping wet to see the man standing in my bathroom. “Hello again, friend,” he said. “You scared me,” I replied. “I know,” he said. “Listen to me. Tonight you are going to talk to your wife. She is ready to have children, but she doesn’t know it yet. She will conceive your son tonight.” My heart swelled at the thought of a son, but my stomach was less optimistic, and it squirmed with uneasiness. “Why are you helping me?” I asked. The man smiled widely. “The strands of fate are long,” he said. “Much longer than a single human life.” He snapped his fingers, and disappeared in a mist of blue-gray smoke. The man never visited again after that, but sometimes I would get that uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach that accompanied his presence. Years passed, then decades, and gradually, I forgot about him--until the day the police came. They came with bloodhounds and shovels, and they turned my entire property inside out. After all was said and done, they’d found the remains of thirty-seven women, and arrested my only son. My son claimed throughout the trial that a demon had forced him to commit the murders, but the prosecution did not believe it, and he was sentenced to death. But I recognized the demon from the thousands of sketches that filled his notebooks. It was a gaunt-faced man with a wide, friendly smile of crooked, dead gray teeth. x",

      "title": "I'm a therapist, and my patient has severe OCD. Every time he misses a ritual, something terrible actually happens.",
      "content": "\"Love one. Love two…\" As he spoke, Phil held his hand to his heart and raised one finger, then two. Then he bowed his head and whispered one last sentence: \"Sorry for bothering you.\" In my notebook, I finished sketching that pointy S symbol that we all drew in high school. I never actually write anything down, but it gives patients the comforting idea that I'm in the process of \"figuring it out\". \"How often do you perform this ritual, Phil?\" I asked. He looked up. \"Every five minutes.\" He had a messy beard and a weathered face that made him appear much older than he probably was. \"Five minutes?\" I repeated, trying not to sound too surprised. That was unusually frequent, even for a patient with severe OCD. \"Do you feel any relief after the ritual is complete?\" He shook his head. \"Never.\" \"What are you afraid will happen if you don't perform the ritual?\" He closed his eyes and shook his head. \"Phil, you can tell me,\" I said encouragingly. \"That's what I'm here for.\" He took a deep breath. \"The-- The man with two knives.\" Fear of death or murder was one of the most common manifestations of OCD. But of course, I didn't want to minimize his fear, which was still very real to him. \"That sounds frightening, Phil,\" I said. \"Can you tell me more about this man?\" He swallowed. \"If I miss a ritual, he comes in the middle of the night. And he-- he --\" \"It's okay,\" I said gently. \"I don't want to upset you.\" I turned to his wife, who was anxiously massaging his knee with her hand. \"Anne, how has this impacted you?\" I asked. \"It must be difficult, seeing your husband suffer this way. You must worry every day, especially when he's at work or traveling?\" \"He never leaves the house,\" she said quietly. \"This is the first time he's been out in three years. He's been on disability the whole time. He's so terrified. And--\" My new assistant, Noah, opened the door. \"Noah, I'm in the middle of a session.\" \"Sorry, it's the school.\" He blushed. \"They said it's urgent. They want to talk about Emma's trial.\" I shook my head and apologized. \"I'll be right back.\" As I walked out of the office, Noah stood in the doorway and stared at Phil and Anne. Apparently he learned nothing from orientation. But I didn't have time to deal with him right now. I stepped out and took the call. The school wanted me to testify in Emma's favor, which I was already planning to do. I got the sense they were more worried I would try to blame the school, as revenge for firing me. But revenge is petty, especially at the cost of a young person's future. I finished the call and returned to my office. \"I'm so sorry for the interruption,\" I said as I took my seat. \"Now, there's good news and bad news here. The bad news is that you certainly seem to be suffering from a severe case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The good news is that you came in for help, and OCD is very treatable.\" Phil leaned forward. \"You can stop him?\" \"Yes,\" I said confidently. \"I'm not a huge fan of medication, but I think antidepressants could help take the edge off while we begin a regimen of mindfulness and talk therapy. In a few months, those rituals will be a thing of the past. My whole team is here to help you.\" I didn't want to refer him out to my colleagues too quickly, but this was a pretty classic case of OCD, and I felt that my resources might be better spent on patients with more unusual issues. Phil shook his head. \"No.\" \"I'm sorry?\" \"No, I can't take medications. I can't stop the rituals.\" \"Of course you can,\" I said. \"That's why we're here.\" \"No,\" he said again. \"Otherwise he'll do it again.\" I was becoming a bit frustrated by this point. \"Phil, that's the whole reason--\" \"Show us,\" Phil said to his wife. She winced and shook her head slightly. \"Please,\" Phil pleaded. \"Show us.\" Anne closed her eyes and lifted up her shirt. Her torso was covered in at least a dozen stab wounds. Before I even had a chance to react, Phil held his hand to his heart again. \"Love one. Love two…\" Jesus Christ. Had it already been five minutes? \"Sorry for bothering you.\" [\\[Patient #116 - Part 1 - View Other Patient Files\\]]( [\\[Part 2\\]](",

      "content": "\"Hello there.\" Clear blue sky, a gentle breeze blowing through the suburbs, the smell of freshly cut grass and a confused little girl staring up at me, sitting in her own little corner far far away from the other children. Mousey little thing with long blond hair in a pony-tail, wearing a plain white shirt with some logo, pink skirt and blue pants underneath. She looked just as anxious as I was feeling. \"... Mumumeesezicantalktostrangers.\" \"Sorry?\" \"My mummy says I can't talk to strangers.\" I squatted and looked right into her eyes. She looked at her shoes. \"Well, my name is Christopher and I'm a friend of your mummy, actually.\" She turned her head slightly. \"... Really?\" \"Michelle Bain, tall, messy brown hair, big nose, baggy eyes?\" \"... Yeah.\" \"So what's your name?\" \"E-Emily.\" \"Emily Bain. You want to get some ice cream?\" \"... But, my teacher...\" \"It's right around the corner. We'll be back in five minutes.\" I held her hand in mine as we made our way to the mall right next to the school. The ice cream man handed us both soft serve with sprinkles, her favourite. She mumbled thank you. He laughed and complimented me for raising such a polite young girl. We finished our ice cream sitting outside and I even got to wipe her nose off, all white and sprinkled. She giggled really hard at that. Instead of heading back, I took us to the toy store across the ice cream place. \"Come on, you can pick anything you want.\" \"Ehhh, I, ummm...\" \"Don't worry about it, OK?\" \"O-OK...\" After much badgering she finally picked out a Freddy plushie, you know, one of those evil robots from that Five Nights At Freddy game? I don't get it myself. Just as we were heading back to school through the parking lot, a woman in the distance spotted us and sprinted our way. Middle-aged woman, brown pixie cut, glasses, kind of cute. Far out in the distance I could see smoke rising. \"Emily, where were you?! We were looking all over for you!\" \"I'm sorry\", I interjected, \"I took her out for some ice cream.\" She gave me the stink eye. \"And you are...\" \"Christopher, family friend.\" \"Ah, I see... Well, we really must get going now. It's an emergency, so good bye.\" As the teacher dragged her back, Emily looked to me and waved and I waved right back. Poor thing didn't even realize what was in store for her. It's quite strange, really. A freak incident in our little town. Faulty wiring, huge fire, single mother, knocked out cold and perished. No other family in the picture. Such a shame. But Emily recognized me when I came to visit her at the police station and I had a clean sheet and a stable income, so soon she was mine for the grabbing. Today is her birthday, actually. Just me, her and a few uncles. She doesn't like crowds, you see. We all doted on her, spoiled her rich, ate some cake and had a couple of beers. Yet I can't sleep. I entered her bedroom and sat right next to her. Sound asleep. I pulled her shirt up. The scars are still there, right on her back. I kidnapped a child and I have no regrets.",

      "content": "The first victim was Emily Stout. She was the sweetest thing, coming up from South Carolina to make it on Broadway. I met her at the subway station, her blonde hair was gorgeous, really well cared for. Her blues eyes were cute, and then her smile, would easily brighten up your day. Unfortunately, everything about her turned repulsive when I got to her. When the police found her, most of her teeth was missing, her hair ripped to shreds, and her eyes popped out of their sockets. Everytime I look at her picture, it brings a smile to my face, until I remember how she looked when I left her. The next victim was Roger Parks. He was this big shot stock broker. He put most of his money in stocks because he believed that's where all the money will grow. Well finally one day his stocks went down hard. Lost all of his money in the 2008 depression. He looked so depressed when I made my attack, like he was ready to die. The police found him the same way they found the first victim, but he had his brief case still. Inside of it was all of his papers he needed, and the most disturbing thing was that he had a picture of his family on him. Maybe he just wanted one last goodbye. The third victim was Victoria Smith. She was this 40-something, mother of three. She was definitely keeping good shape at her age. She would always complain about how her kids dont have time for her anymore, and how her husband wont pay her any attention. They found her with her guts pulled out of her body, skull crushed, and her body becoming jelly. I have her picture with her family, the family that didn't give her enough attention. The fourth victim was Kelly Saprano. She worked the ticket booth at the subway station. I saw her every day she worked after school. Pretty little thing, her burnette hair was amazing, her smile always brightened me up when I had my darkest days, and she always was down to talk whenever. I wished I never touched her. Looking back she was the victim I regret killing the most. She was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. Her picture is her with the dog filter on her face, and she's wearing her metro uniform. The fifth and most recent victim was Todd Labowski. He was this wannabe youtuber, performing stupid stunts to get views. I watched his videos after the killing and he seemed like an entitled D-bag. His last stunt was the worst one he could have think of. He was getting my attention, trying to piss me off. Well he got what he wanted, to piss me off. His body was the worst out of all of them, they couldn't even recognize who he was, they had to go off dental records to see who he was. Somehow the camera was intaked so they looked at the footage. What they saw was me, trying to tell him to get off the track before I ran him over with the subway car. After every death, everyone tell me it's not your fault, but I cant help just remembering them in there last moments. I starting to feel better when I took pictures of them and hang them in the subway cars I drive for the day. I went to everyone's funeral, to make sure they had someone to remember them. Emily had to go into prostitution, became a heavy user of drugs. Roger became affiliated with loan sharks and made a hole to big to come out of. Victoria lost everything, her kids went out of state, her husband was a gay man the whole time, the cherry on top was she found out she had skin cancer and she had months to live. Kelly was a victim of bullying. Her note said she loved every one that made her smile, she even mentioned me. Todd seemed like a stunt gone wrong but actually he was battling depression and his stunts were his way of trying to end it all. To the people who are battling depression or are going through a rough spot in their life just know that someone will remember you fondly, even if it's the guy who sees you in your final seconds.",

      "content": "My husband locked me in the spare bedroom hours ago. I was lying on the couch in the living room, reading, when he called out for me. I found him in the spare room and when I walked in, he pushed past me and locked the door. I thought he was pranking me or joking around but he said, “it’s safe in here. Do not make a sound. I’m not kidding Grace. When you hear this knock, it’s safe to come out. If the door unlocks but you don’t hear that knock, do not open the door.” Then he knocked a special knock. “Repeat it, so I know you know it,” he called. “What the hell is going on? Jack this isn’t funny. You better let me out right now,” I shouted, banging on the door. “Do the goddamn knock Grace. Do not make a sound. I’m serious. I’ll tell you when it’s safe. I love you.” I’d never heard him sound so aggressive. I repeated his knock, and then I heard him walk away. I paced the room. I was worried but I trusted Jack. I sat by the door for awhile hoping I’d hear something but there was only silence. I looked out the window afterwards, but all I could see was the house next to ours, and not much else. I decided to take a nap to pass the time. I wasn’t sure when Jack would be back and I was getting restless. Eventually I fell asleep and I dreamt that I was chained to the bed and that I was being watched. I woke up in a sweat. I was tempted to call out to Jack but I could hear a noise. I walked over to the door slowly and could very clearly hear heavy breathing coming from right outside the door. I tried to look through the crack under the door and saw a dark shadow. Suddenly I could hear knocks on the door. It wasn’t the same special knock that Jack had done. The knocks got louder and louder and soon it sounded like someone slamming their whole body against the door. I covered my mouth just in case, but I didn’t scream. I looked around the room for something I could use as a weapon, but the spare room is scarcely decorated. I picked up the lamp, hoping it’d suffice. The knocks/slams eventually stopped and the house again became silent other than my heavy breathing. I stood at the door ready with my lamp for what felt like eternity. The footsteps started a long time later. First they were moving so quickly and quietly, but then the became slow and loud. With every heavy thud, they were getting louder and louder. Closer and closer. Whoever was there unlocked the door. Then I heard the knock. Jack’s special knock. “You can come out now Grace.” It didn’t sound like Jack though. It sounded like someone mimicking Jack. I didn’t dare speak. I stood there, clutching my lamp, holding my breath, saying a silent prayer. “YOU CAN COME OUT NOW GRACE!” The voice yelled over and over, piercing my ears. And then again, the silence. Every so often I can hear the sound of chains. And every so often the footsteps approach the door and do Jack’s special knock, and I’m told I can come out. The mimic is getting closer and closer to the sound of my Jack, but I know it’s not him. I know it’s not safe.",

      "content": "This week, I was supposed to digitize all of doctor. Marnen's patient files. I was feeling good about my progress when I saw it. A second filing cabinet, hiding behind the shelves, that I’d never noticed before. Sighing with fatigue, I yanked open the first drawer. I plucked out a file from the ‘A’ section and began to read. ABERDEEN, CARLA “Alright, Carla, let’s see if you’re in the system.” I set the file on the desk, sat down at the computer, and typed in her name. Nothing came up. Oh, hell no. I am not doing ALL the files in this cabinet. But I sighed, opened a new patient file, and began copying the data. Carla Aberdeen… DOB 4/24/72… 5’ 9”, 176 lbs… Finally, I got to the doctor’s notes. They were written in messy script, as if in a hurry. I put on my glasses, and read: - Complaints of eczema - Itchiness after eating some fruits - Lungs may be useful I stopped and re-read the last line. Lungs may be useful I shrugged, figuring it was some sort of mistake or reference to something. I typed it into the computer and took the next file from the cabinet – a mister. David Akowski. But the doctor’s notes were even stranger, this time. - Family history of heart attacks - Large skin surface area I typed him into the system and stared at the screen. Large skin surface area? What does that even mean? When I got to the next one—a Miss Katerina Alanson—I felt the knot in my stomach tighten. History of work stress & anxiety Recent panic attack Feet are perfect size I rolled away from the computer. Heart pounding, I picked up the file and studied it. There must be an explanation. But I couldn’t think of any. I took a deep breath. Then I picked up the phone and dialed the number on Katerina’s file. But what will I say? I didn’t even know. I just had a terrible, nagging feeling, and wanted to do something about it. But I wasn’t in luck. Boop-boop-boop! We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected – “What are you doing?” I whipped around. doctor. Marnen was standing in the doorway, his arms crossed over his white coat. “I was digitizing the files. Like you told me to,” I stuttered, slamming the phone down. “Not those files.” He violently grabbed the files from the desk, shoved them back into the file cabinet. Then he pulled a small key from his pocket and turned the locks on each drawer. Click, click, click. “Finish this up, okay?” I nodded. And then he was gone. The silence pressed in. The waiting room was empty and still. I checked the clock – 4:45. No more patients would be coming in. It was only doctor. Marnen and me in the office now. So I did what any reasonable person would do. I shut down the computer, grabbed my coat, and started for the door. As I hurried towards the exit, I saw doctor. Marnen at the end of the hall. He was opening a door – the door he told me went to the supply closet. But beyond him, I could see a set of stairs, snaking down into the darkness.",

      "title": "9-1-1, What's Your Emergency?",
      "content": "\"H-hello?\" My eight-year-old voice trembled, “Is this emergency services?” “It sure is!” the cheerful male voice on the other end of the phone line answered. “What’s the trouble, young man?” I frowned. ‘Young man?’ Weren’t they supposed to say ‘9-1-1, what’s your emergency?!’ Maybe it was his first day. Either way, there was no time to waste. “Something’s wrong with my mom. She fell down all of a sudden.” I pressed the phone to my ear and leaned back. My mother lay where she’d collapsed just minutes ago. “Oh no! That’s too bad! Someone will be over right away.” Click. I dropped the phone and crept over to my mother. The faint rise and fall of her chest was the only way I even knew she was alive. Wait…I hadn’t told the ambulance people our address! I ran back to the phone and dialed 9-1-1 again. “151 Cliffmore Way! 151 Cliffmore Way!” I shouted into the receiver, then hung up. I shut my eyes tight. I wanted to scream, to shatter into a million pieces like the glass that had fallen from my mother’s grasp just before she collapsed– But all I could do was wait, hold her hand, and pray. It felt like an eternity before the doorbell rang. I sprang to my feet, but froze when I turned the corner. A short, brown-haired white man was peering through the window with a grin on his face. He rang the bell again, more instantly this time, and I noticed he wore a red nurse’s uniform. I left out a sigh of relief. The ambulance people were here. Everything was going to be okay. I yanked the door open. “Hello there, young man!” The smiling man exclaimed. I read the name ‘Marbas’ on his nametag, right beside the pens and stethoscope. “Where’s the un-lucky lady?” he asked. “You mean my mom?” I stammered: “S-she’s in here…” Two expressionless assistants in identical red uniforms rolled a guernsey to where my mother lay, surrounded by shards of glittering glass. “Up, up, and away!” Nurse Marbas rubbed his hands together excitedly while my mother was loaded into the guernsey and rolled out the door. A jolt of helpless fear shot through me: they were taking my mother away! “Uh, mister? Can I ride with my mom to the hospital?” I asked the smiling man. “Hospital?” Nurse Marbas wrinkled his forehead, confused. “Oh, there’s no need for that. We’re professionals, you see.” As the assistants loaded my mother into the back of the black ambulance, I looked over their shoulders at the sharp and jagged tools hanging from its walls. They weren’t like any medical instruments that I’d ever seen. “We’ll take excellent care of your mother,” the smiling man went on, “and call as soon as you can see her!” Nurse Marbas leapt into the rear compartment, his expressionless assistants climbed into the cab, and the black ambulance began to back out of the driveway. I ran behind it, waving my hands. I wanted to yell at them to stop, but I was just a kid: who was I to contradict the professionals? I was still standing there five minutes later, when flashing red-and-blue lights came skidding around the street corner. The two police officers muttered into their radios and looked worriedly at the scene in front of them: a crying child, a wide-open door. “Did you call 9-1-1?” a blonde policewoman asked. “I did,” I nodded, “but they already came. They took my mom away.” The two police officers looked at each other. “I’m afraid that’s not possible. We received a call from this location–a child shouting an address–and we’re the first ones to respond…” It’s been twenty years since the black ambulance drove off with my mother. I never learned what became of her, or of the strange nurses in the red uniforms. My foster parents said I made it all up. Trauma, they said. I had to forget, move on. But around midnight last night, I received a strange phone call. A woman’s gravelly, rasping voice–almost inaudible over the screams and crackling flames in the background. A voice I recognized: “They told me that I could call…we’re going to be together again soon…son.” X",

I didn’t move, I was supposed to be there. I waited. I was vaguely aware of my consciousness, the thoughts that make me me, lost somewhere in my head. My consciousness was scared, confused, and frantic. It tried to gain control of my body again. It couldn’t. I heard front door open, and a man walked through. He said nothing. I waited until I could see him. He rounded the corner. I was supposed to greet him. “Hello,” I said. “Hello,” he said without moving his mouth. I heard it, but not with my ears. It was loud. My consciousness recoiled. My eyes did not move from his, but I took in his appearance. My eyes were not supposed to move from his. His arms and legs were too long for his gaunt, pale body. I was not supposed to notice this, so I didn’t. He was a strange man. “You are a strange man,” I said. “Yes,” he replied without moving his mouth. My consciousness didn’t like that. “Don’t like that,” I said. He smiled without moving his mouth. A hand finally moved towards my face. It was long and bony with too many joints. I wasn’t supposed to notice this, so I didn’t. He touched his hand to my forehead. He slithered into my mind and looked around, rifling through my thoughts and memories. My consciousness screamed and writhed in agony, calling out for someone to help. It hurt. It hurt me. It hurt my body. I stepped back. I wasn’t supposed to step back. The man looked at me. He was angry. He screamed with a thousand voices. I stood in the bedroom of a house I almost recognized. A few pieces of furniture were scattered here and there. There were faint voices and car horns outside. The man took a step towards me. My eyes did not move from his, they weren’t supposed to. I was supposed to let him touch my face. “I am supposed to let you touch my face.” “Yes,” he said. His mouth did not move. His long, twisted hand reached for my face. I was supposed to let him take my mind for himself. “I am supposed to let you take my mind.” My consciousness screamed. It seemed louder now. “Yes,” he replied loudly. I took a second step back. “I will not.” The man was angry. He screamed in a thousand voices. I stood in the middle of the bedroom of a house I began to recognize. This was my bedroom. It was filled with furniture and knickknacks. The busy city was loud outside. There was a strange man in my home. His arms and legs were too long for his body. His limbs were long and bony with too many joints. I wasn’t supposed to notice this. My eyes were not supposed to move from his. They did. He wasn’t a man at all. Get out of my house, my consciousness screamed. “Get out of my house,” I screamed. “Get out of my house,” my consciousness and I screamed together. I was slammed back into my body with so much force that I stumbled. The man, the thing in front of me recoiled and screamed. I was filled with a rage I’d never felt before. I lunged at it, wanting to destroy whatever it was. Wanting to kill it so that it could never shove its way inside my mind again. It screamed, an awful sound that didn’t belong to it, that belonged to many other people it took for itself. It flung itself towards the front door. “You will not return here,” I growled. It screamed that awful scream at me. “YOU WILL NOT RETURN HERE,” I roared. “I will not return here,” it said, it’s mouth never moving. It flung itself out of the front door. I collapsed. This was my house. This was my mind. You are not supposed to notice when he comes. Notice.",

      "title": "If You Hear a Baby Crying in the Woods, Don't Follow It, Pictures Included",
      "content": "Last Friday I was driving on a windy backroad in the mountains of rural Utah. I was around ten miles from the nearest town when my engine died. I pulled out my phone to look at the map. There was no service, but I’d downloaded a map of the area just in case. I saw that, if I followed the road, it was a ten mile walk that wound back and forth along some backroads. I didn’t like that idea very much. I also saw that the town was actually only two miles away as the crow flies. In a direct line from me, I’d just have to climb a little bit to cut my journey down. I shot a look up the mountain, left a note on my car saying what I was doing, and set off through the brush. That part of Utah didn’t have much underbrush, just some scraggly bushes and the occasional tree clinging to life in the dry soil. I was making good time, and soon had shut off my phone’s light to rely on the moon which was a bright pearl in the sky. When my eyes had adjusted, it was almost like walking around in the daytime. The valley extended for dozens of miles to my right, and the weather was only slightly chilly with the wind. That was when I heard a baby’s cry, low on the wind. It was far off in the distance to my left, slightly higher up the slope. I paused, listening hard. It came again, unmistakably the pinched short cry of a newborn infant. I paused for a moment before heading in the direction of the call. There was no one around for miles, and now there’s this kid? After a few minutes of walking, I stumbled across what had to have been a hundred-year-old cemetery. There were no headstones, just rocks marking the spots where the people must’ve been buried. I couldn’t hear any more crying. I took a short video walking around the cemetery which you can see here: VIDEO OF THE CEMETERY: I put my phone away in my back pocket, listening hard for the kid. I figured it must’ve been an animal. I thought I’d heard that coyotes could mimic human cries. Then I turned to look at the moon, only now noticing it was had been ringed by thick dark clouds. Almost as if on cue, the clouds rushed forward. Over the course of five seconds, the cemetery went from lit up by moonlight, to pitch blackness. The clouds must’ve been covering every star in the sky as well as the moon. The darkness was complete. I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. It was so black that it seemed almost physical, enveloping and dulling each of my senses. Then the baby cried again from my left, loud and piercing. I jerked, caught my foot on a rock, and fell forward against on of the fences. The baby was shrieking loudly. It couldn’t have been more than a few feet away, just on the other side of the fence. I pushed back, sticking my hand into my pocket, feeling for my phone to turn on a light. That’s when the dry papery fingers slid around the back of my throat. Nails dug into the skin, and I thought I heard a high raspy giggle from behind me just before they began to squeeze. I jerked forward, flipped on my light, and spun around. There was nothing there. I ran away, trying to put as much distance between myself and the cemetery as I could. When I finally reached the town, I put my hand up to my neck and felt the scrapes on my neck. I told myself it was just a tree, but I knew that wasn’t true. I managed to get an old mechanic to come help me with my car. On the way back I asked him a question about a cemetery up in the hills. He stiffened, looked at me, and said: We don’t go up there. We know better. /r/WorchesterStreet",

      "content": "My wife came home after midnight. She was covered in blood, but it was not hers. I was sitting alone in the kitchen eating a plate of peanut butter and crackers. “Long night?” I asked. “You bet,” she said, her voice tinged with fatigue. One by one she took off her large rubber boots, then unzipped her body length polypropylene coveralls. I gave her a hand to help her out. She filled the kitchen sink with hot soapy water then dropped in a clatter of steak knives. I kiss her on the back of her neck and say, “Go to sleep, sweety.” “But I have to clean off the...” she trailed off. “It’s okay, I’ll do it,” I said. I could have added, “I’ll clean off the blood,” but I did not. I never ask about her late night excursions. I think that is what makes us a great couple. When she came home last month with a black eye and minor lacerations, I did not ask any questions. I cleaned out her cut with warm water and gentle soap; then I went to the fridge and grabbed an ice pack for her eye. I made her a nest on the couch and she fell asleep to reruns of The Addams Family. When I came home a week later to find her parading around the living room in a human skin coat and a necklace of ears, I did not ask any questions. Instead I gave her a peck on the cheek and went to our bedroom to get changed. When I found the shower drain clogged with viscera a few days later, I will admit that I had lots of questions. But I did not ask a single one. Instead, I tore off a paper towel, picked up the larger bits of flesh and poured Draino until the water flowed freely. We have been married for over a decade. Like any couple, we have had our ups and downs. We have based our relationship on a firm foundation of trust. Part of that trust is being of aware of times when ignorance is better than knowledge. Unlike other couples who are mired in suspicions, jealousy, and conjecture, we have persevered. Trust, when reciprocated, feels like a special kind of magic. Last night, she came home early. I had not cleared off the chalk pentagram from the living room floor, and the sacrifices were still writhing in a puddle of blood on the floor. I heard the front door click shut and I found her gazing at me. I was terrified: what would she think of me? Not a soul knows about my pastime. Instead, she just smiled at me. She asked if I wanted a cup of coffee. I mumbled “yes please” and she disappeared into the kitchen. I quickly finished the ritual, mopped up the blood, and placed the bodies in our garage freezer. I found her sitting at the kitchen table. My coffee was still steaming. I noticed she had made me a plate of peanut butter and crackers. She did not ask anything about the pentagram or the bodies. I thought she would have commented on the metal skewers or the electric cables. But she said nothing. Instead, she asked if I wanted to snuggle up on the couch and watch some more The Addams Family. I could not think of a better way to spend an evening.",

      "content": "For weeks, I knew I was being stalked. It started with my bras. Everything I’d meticulously sorted by color had been sifted through and returned out of order, unwrinkled, but… changed. And they felt different. Like they’d been washed with the wrong detergent, or touched with soapy hands. But it wasn’t just that. There was a wrongness in my apartment. The floor creaked randomly. One day I found a large handprint on my mirror that hadn’t been there when I left for work in the morning. There was an odor, too, one I’d only smelled at funeral homes before. Then one night I woke up to the feeling of hot breath in my face, like a dog was inches away, panting at me. I sat up and heard a thump and something landed on my floor. “Go away!” I screamed as footsteps retreated into the distance. I turned on all the lights and found the room empty, but I never did go back to sleep. The next morning, I stepped out of bed and felt a sharp pain in my foot. Looking down, I found a sharp, needle-like object embedded in the floor. I took it to the bathroom to look at it under stronger light and realized that the needle turned transparent when viewed from certain angles. I tried to look online, but I couldn’t find anything like the needle. Then, in the middle of my next search, my router went out. The sounds mostly came at night, but then things started happening in the daytime too. A pair of my running sneakers disappeared right after a jog. And then, when I was showering, I heard someone whisper, “Oh my god, you’re so beautiful.” I screamed and screamed and screamed. The next morning, I bought a gun. The guy at the store, a bearded fatherly type, tried to sell me on a 9mm that looked like a toy, but I sprung for a Sig Sauer 365, complete with a 10 + 1 magazine. I hadn’t gone shooting since my dad had taken me to the range back in my teens, so I figured I might need a few shots. That night, I slipped the gun under my pillow and went to sleep. I woke up to the feeling of someone stroking my bare shoulder. My hips felt pinned to the mattress. I cried out in panic and pushed up as hard as I could. I heard a grunt, and then something grabbed my wrists and pushed me down. I felt the wet of lips on mine. Then I swung my knee up and felt it collide with something soft. I heard a groan, and then something thumped on the hardwood beside the bed. I reached over, grabbed my gun, and shot at the groan until my clip was half-empty. There was a hacking cough. And then a voice begging. “Wait. Please. Don’t. I love you.” I emptied the rest of the clip and the voice was gone. There’s a warm wet pool on my bedroom floor now. I’ve been trying to mop it up, but it’s hard, because there’s nothing to see. Then there’s the invisible thing. It’s a little bigger than me, and I’m not sure how I’ll possibly lift it. A few minutes ago, as I was looking for my mop in the garage, another strange thing happened. My front door slowly opened and closed. I heard a few sets of footsteps enter. They walked to my bedroom. Since then, I’ve been hearing the sound of tape unrolling and bottles spraying. They’re cleaning up, I realize. But what I don’t yet know is if I’m part of the mess.",

      "content": "Looks like you’re using a new device. Please verify your identity with the following security questions. Ugh. I hated answering those questions. I resentfully clicked “OK.\" What was the name of your childhood best friend? My hands hovered over the keyboard. Two people came to mind—Michael Dobrevsky and Drew Suresh. I hadn’t talked to them in years, but considered them best friends back then. I couldn’t remember which I’d entered when I made the account, so I started with Michael. Incorrect Answer. This is why I hate these questions. Worse than a password. I typed in Drew. Incorrect Answer. I tried first and last names. Nicknames. Last names only. Every time, the same message popped up: Incorrect Answer. I sat there, confused, staring at the screen. Skip this question, I clicked, finally. But the next question had me even more confused. What was the name of your high school? Franklin High, I entered. Incorrect Answer. What? Frowning, I entered Franklin High School. Franklin Township High School. Every permutation of \"Franklin\" and \"High School\" I could think of. Anything that it could possibly be. But each time, those two words popped up, burning into my brain. Incorrect Answer. Skip this question, I clicked, and the next question popped up. Do you remember now, David? I jolted back from the screen. What the hell? My heart pounded and I suddenly felt dizzy. Faint. I wiped at my face, feeling the walls closing in. Then I blinked. No. That’s not what it said. I misread it. I reread the sentence: Did you receive a text just now, David? We’re going to try to verify your account a different way. Enter the verification code we sent to (XXX)-XXX-1539... Everything is fine. I picked up my phone and began tapping at the screen—then jerked my fingers back. What is that? Something wet and dark coated the glass, sticking to my fingertips. I wiped the phone off on my shirt, grimacing, and opened the text. Fingers shaking, I slowly entered the code into the site. Thank you, David. You’re all set! I stood up, stretched, and walked towards the kitchen. I needed a drink after all this. After rummaging in the pantry for a few minutes, I pulled out a bottle of Jim Beam and poured myself a shot. As I tipped my head back to drain it, I saw the blood. So much blood, pooling out from something unseen in the family room. My heart beat painfully in my chest as I crept forward. A body. Face down. His jean pocket was turned inside-out, and strewn across the carpet were his wallet, his keys. No phone. Trembling, I reached for the wallet and pulled out a driver’s license. The first name jumped out at me. DAVID I reached into my own pocket and pulled out my wallet. But I already knew the truth, now. I wasn’t David. I never was. I glanced over at my laptop, and his phone, sitting next to it. The bank’s account homepage, filling the screen, showing thousands of dollars ready to be transferred. I’d done this. I remembered, now.",

      "content": "Everyone in my area has their thoughts centered on a single event that occurred just two days ago. An event that has brought many people to tears for the sheer horror of the situation; we all lost something that day. My best friend, Andrew, died in every parent's nightmare-a school shooting. He sent me text messages as it started until the end of his life. I couldn't stop reading them over and over again, emotions overwhelming me in waves. I can't talk to anyone about this, not even my parents-this is a very personal matter. But I need to somehow let it out, and this reddit community is the only place I know I can reach out to. That's why I've decided to transcribe my dear friend's last words to me here, completely unaltered. Andrew: 11:42 | hey dude we have a stupid surprise lockdown rn 11:42 | wish I were home sick like you lol Me: 11:43 | rip they usually tell you about those drills. How longs it gonna last?

The sound of it smashing into the adjoining wall felt like a proper signal for my grand entrance as I stepped in and began to fill my fellow students with an onslaught of bullets. I saw my dear, best friend Andrew hit the 'send' button for his last message before gazing up at me in speechless disbelief.",

      "title": "Daycare",
      "content": "I recently put my daughter in daycare. I didn’t want to do it, but being that I’m a single parent, I don’t have much of a choice. After dubious research, I found a daycare center that seemed like a good fit. It was run by a girl named Wendy and seemed fairly popular in the neighborhood, as there were a number of kids there when I went to investigate. One of the things I particularly liked about it was the fact that they had security cameras set up around the center so that parents can get access to them and check on their kids. It quickly became an obsession of mine. All the kids wore jackets that they daycare provided, because the air conditioner had been on the fritz so it was quite cold there, but it was easy to tell which little girl was mine. I loved being able to watch my daughter play with other kids as I worked and it gave me the peace of mind knowing that she was doing all right. I couldn’t keep my eyes glued to the screen the entire time, but in passing I saw that she had made a friend she played with almost every day, and even had a favorite toy. It was a little medicine ball that she and her friend would toss back and forth. They played with it every day. After about a week, things seemed to be going quite well. My little girl had started really grasping potty-training and was more well-behaved than I’d ever known her to be. Needless to say, I was impressed with the daycare. That was when she started singing the song. She hummed it at first, and when I asked her what it was, she told me it was a song they taught her at daycare. Eventually she learned all the words and began to sing. We eat their teeth And eat their bones And slit their throats inside their homes We sing this song And when we’re done We’ll go to hell and have more fun. She sang it all the time, no matter how many times I had to ask her to stop. It made my skin crawl. Why would they teach a song like that to children? The next day, with the song stuck in my head, I resolved to call Wendy. I wanted to tell her that I disapproved of that song and I didn’t want that or anything else like it taught to my daughter. If it continued, I would be forced to find a new daycare. As I watched the children play on my computer screen, my little girl playing with the ball like she always did, I picked up my phone and called the daycare. When Wendy answered, I told her about my concern. She was incredibly polite about it and said that one of the other children had been going around singing it – she said she thought it was from a movie or something - but she was working on putting a stop to it because that song was definitely not for children. She said it disturbed her just as much as it did me. I’d been pacing around my office as I spoke to her, and just as we were saying goodbye, I looked back down at the screen and noticed something peculiar. The Wendy on the screen was not on the phone, but was helping a child with his juice box. She said goodbye and hung up the phone, and I watched the cameras, not reciprocating her farewell, but transfixed on the screen in front of me. I stared at my daughter and her playing with her ball and tried to think of how many time’s I’d seen her drop it as they tossed it back and forth. I didn’t think I’d seen that happen very much. And the kid in the corner was always in the corner, working on the same puzzle. How long had he been working on that puzzle? That’s when I began to suspect that instead of watching a live feed, I’d been watching a recording. Part 2",

      "title": "I can see stains on people that nobody else can see",
      "content": "The first time it happened was in school. During fourth-period English. miss. Callman arrived to class, late as usual, carrying her signature leather bag. She bent down to put it on the floor, and took her seat, before looking back up to the class. I did a double take when I saw her face. She had a great big stain splashed across her head. It was some kind of dark brown...coppery-colored blotch dried onto her temple. She went about taking out her books as if she didn't have some sort of curry stain or something crusted onto her forehead. I went from amused to worried when I looked around to see literally nobody else reacting to it either. I leaned over to the guy sitting next to me. \"Hey dude\", I said. \"Are you seeing this?\" \"Seeing what?\" \"The...thing on her face, man\", I chuckled. He stared back at me as if I had three heads. Realizing that clearly no-one else could see what I saw, I dropped it. I went home, freaking out slightly. Maybe it was a trick of the light? Or some kind of optical thing? But it stayed there on her face throughout the whole class. The next day, I returned to school, only to be called into an assembly with the entire student and staff population. The principal came out to break the news to us. miss. Callman had committed suicide the previous night. It wasn't until later, when I heard that the cause of death was a gunshot to the head did I really start to panic. We were sent home for the rest of the day and I walked out of school with a cold, sick feeling in my stomach. Eventually, my parents came home and just as I was starting to put all of that out of my head, my dad walked through the door. He stumbled back when I let out an involuntary scream of terror. Mom and Dad just stared at me. Covering the entire front of his overalls was a large, deep red stain smeared across his stomach and torso. I could tell by their reactions that neither of them could see it either. I immediately ran to my room, with my parents close behind. Panicked, they asked me what was going on. I just pointed at Dad's overalls. He looked down. \"What is it?\", he asked. He rubbed his hand over the stain as if it wasn't there. I just kept gawking in terror. \"Maybe we should call a doctor\", my mom said. \"How about we just let you get a good night's rest, buddy\", Dad told me reassuringly. I didn't sleep the entire night. When morning finally came, I begged Dad not to go to work but of course he still went. Mom booked an appointment with our doctor before heading off to work also. I stayed home from school and between fits of sweaty anxiety, I would call Dad's cellphone constantly to check in on him. The day crawled by and eventually Mom arrived in the door. \"Dad must be working late\", she said. I immediately called his cell...with no answer. A little while later, from the kitchen, I heard Mom take a phone call. Before she'd even said hello, my blood was already running cold and I was already crying. A few seconds later, she was sobbing even harder than I was. I didn't bother going into the kitchen. It was a freak accident. He was working on a car at the garage when something went wrong...the car had collapsed and crushed him. The following days and the funeral were like a nightmarish fever dream. Everything went by in slow motion. I felt limp and numb. Once home from the funeral, I went to the bathroom. And then I saw it. As I washed my hands and looked up into the mirror, there it was. A big, red stain tracking all the way around my neck. Sobbing in horror for what felt like the millionth time, I stumbled downstairs to Mom, who was curled up in an armchair, sniffling. I tried explaining. But how could I? \"Please stop this\", Mom asked, crying. \"You're just confused.\" \"Mom, please...\" \"Please stop\", she begged. \"It's going to happen to me...\", I cried. \"STOP!\", she sobbed. This was last night. As I write this, the stain is still there. I'm not sure what's gonna happen next but I've made arrangements for my aunt to come take care of my mom once I'm gone. In any case, I write this account in the hopes that it may help some of you out there. If you begin to see stains on people that no-one else can...warn them before it's too late.",

I didn’t upset some witch and I didn’t go skinny dipping in a pool of nuclear waste or anything like that. Sometimes terrible things happen without reason, and this is one of them. I shot awake at 12:42 AM with the urgent need to urinate. I waddled into the bathroom, pulled out my package… and just stood there. Nothing came out. “Come on buddy,” I muttered to my member, “what’s the deal? Thought you had some business here.” No response. I gave it a little shake. “Come on now. Don’t have all night. Big meeting in the morning, gotta get some sleep.” I was about ready to put it away and chug a glass of water when I felt a sharp stabbing pain in my inner thigh. It made me hunch over, and I smacked my forehead on the toilet lid. “Fuck,” I muttered, straightening out. I dropped my boxers in order to inspect what was going on down there. I thought maybe a pimple had burst or something like that. Gross, but not as gross as what I saw. Something was poking around under my skin. It looked like a crawling worm, twisting away just beneath the surface. “Nope,” I said. “Just a little sleep deprivation. There’s not really something moving inside of me.” As if to prove me wrong, my flesh started stretching, like something inside was pushing it further and further outward. This event was accompanied by a flash of burning, unforgiving pain. I screamed, and bucked all the way to the ground, arching my back like the letter C. My wife Jess called out from our bedroom a moment later: “Honey? Everything okay in there? I told you not to eat that chili after you left it out all night.” My daughter Ali joined in from her room: “Papa? You shouldn’t have eaten that chili.” “I’m okay!” I lied. “Go back to sleep, girls.” Then, as in the eye of a storm, everything settled down. I still felt like I had to pee, but the weird movement had stopped. But only for a moment. And the following moment brought with it a torrent of misery and horror unlike anything I had ever known. A fleshy knob burst forth from inside my thigh with a gush of pink slime. I had two thoughts in quick succession. First: It’s a dick. Then: No. It’s a nightmare. This isn’t happening. As my mind was turning things over, my mouth was screaming again. I don’t know how long that went on, but eventually Jess was banging at the door. “Henry! Are you okay?! Henry?!” “Get a knife!” I wailed. “Cut if off! Oh God, kill it! Please!” “I’m coming in!” warned Jess. “No!” I cried. But it was too late. She had opened the door, taken one look at the scene before her, and covered her mouth in shock. “I don’t know what’s happening,” I sobbed. Then a jet of yellow fluid shot from the head of the thing, and I could no longer pretend that it wasn’t a second penis. The physical release of the urine felt supremely satisfying, and for a split second, I felt actually content, until I felt the warmth of my own piss pool up around my knees. “Is that….?” started Jess. “Y… yes,” I said. “I don’t know where it came from. Oh god, I’m a monster.” “What do we do? Call 911?” “No, it’s too embarrassing. And I’m so tired. I just… I just want to go to sleep and deal with it in the morning.” I got cleaned up and settled back into bed. I was actually able to sleep for a little bit, I think because all of the adrenaline bursts wore me out. I had nightmares... of dicks sprouting out all over my body… one coming out my chest, one coming out my forehead, dripping in brain… but I was able to sleep. \\ In the morning, it was gone. Even though it would have been hard to miss, I still spent several minutes searching all the folds down there for some sign of it. “Where did it go?” asked Jess. “I don’t know,” I said. “But you did see it, right? That wasn’t just some nightmare, right?” “Not unless two people can have the same nightmare.” “Can they?” I wondered. “I guess it’s possible. No less strange than another cock poking out of your thigh for the night and then disappearing, if you think about it.” “True,” I said thoughtfully. “Maybe it crawled off somewhere? Maybe it was some kind of alien monster that only took the form of a cock?” “Maybe,” said Jess. “You better get moving. You’re going to be late for your meeting.” I did get ready, and I’ll tell you this: I felt great. It felt great not to have a random second penis flopping around on my body. It was one of the best feelings in the world. But that night, it came back. \\ The second night was no picnic either, but nothing will ever be as terrifying to me as that first night. And I’ll tell you the rest of the story: it’s not so bad. After it was accepted that this was going to keep happening every night… it’s not so bad at all. There’s a saying that I consider one of the wisest among sayings. It goes like this: “Happy wife, happy life.” And well, let me put it like this: I have a very happy wife.",

      "title": "My number neighbor just messaged me, but they weren't doing it for the trend",
      "content": "For the first time in a little over a month, I received a text message yesterday morning. When I first saw the number that messaged me, I thought I had gone crazy. I thought it was my number, but after examining it a little closer the second time, I noticed that our number was the same except for the last number. Then I remembered about the dumb little “Number Neighbor” trend, so I rolled my eyes and opened up the text, fully prepared to block the number, but what was written was what stopped me. ”Sorry, but I don’t have a lot of time to explain. I can’t access my internet, and my call won’t even go through with 911. Please. This is my address (sorry I won’t write the address here.) Will you please call 911 for me and tell them that there is someone in my house.” I didn’t think twice, I called 911 and gave them the address and told them about the message I received. After I got off the phone, I sent a message back. ”I called the cops for you, but why didn’t you message anyone else?” It didn’t take a while to get a text back. ”I tried texting everyone on my contact list, but the messages weren’t going through. I got desperate and decided to text every number I could think of, your the only one that messaged back. I hope the cops get here soon. I’m hiding in the closet. I think they already killed my husband and kids.” I didn’t really know what to say, so I sent back a text hoping it would at least calm them down. ”I called the cops. They should be there soon. I’m sure you will be fine if you keep hiding in the closet.” Around ten minutes later, I received a phone call. It wasn’t from the number that texted me. Fearing the worst, I waited for a couple of rings before answering it. ”Hello. This is Officer Stephens. I am told the emergency line received a call from you to check on an address. I’m giving you a call because the house that you reported has been burned down three years ago. Now, can you please tell me if you were doing a little prank or if you really received a text?” Confused and a little pissed, I told him, ”Yeah, I did. I’m sorry if someone was pranking me, but I really did receive a text.” The officer sighed and the line was silent for a couple of seconds before he responded back. ”Alright, if they message back let me know. We have been getting a couple of noise complaints around this neighborhood this morning, but none of the callers could give us an exact house to check on.” I agreed to let him know, and he hung up the phone. Against my better judgment, I tried calling the number that messaged me, but after the second ring, I was sent to voicemail. I tried calling four more times after, but it did the same thing each time. I messaged the number a couple of times, but I never got a response back. The only reason why I am writing to you all right now is because tonight while I was cooking dinner I heard ”Breaking News” come from my tv. I looked at the tv for the next three minutes in absolute horror. Two dead bodies were found in a house that was next to the house I called in for. A man and his little kid. A couple of seconds later my phone vibrated in my pants. I took my phone out and saw that there was a text. ”I really did get you with my texts earlier, didn’t I?:) Don’t get out of your house. I’m right outside. You have six hours left to live before I send my friends into your house;) Do whatever you need to do before then.” I tried calling and messaging people, but it won’t work. I tried Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, hell I even tried Youtube, but none of them work. So I’m posting on here, hoping that maybe this site will work. I live on 168 I’m a dumbass who thought I could post my address when I type it in. Fuck. God damnit, it keeps writing that whenever I write my address. Fuck it. I’m gone. I don’t know what I can do, but I guess take this as a free lesson. When an unknown number messages you, don’t message back. Fuck, don’t get involved. Just call the cops and leave it alone. There obviously isn’t any hope for me, but maybe I can help someone else out in the future. For the last time, I’m logging out.",

      "title": "Dear Wife, There are Some Things You Will Never Realize",
      "content": "You may not have noticed, but the day you walked into the coffee shop I worked at, everyone stopped what they were doing and stared at you for a quick second. You had a pair of blue headphones around your neck and the pink scarf around your neck made you seem just that much cuter. You may not have noticed, but it felt like every cell in my body was melting while you told me your order or how, when you smiled, I lost the feeling in my knees. That is why I fell a little while walking towards the machine to make your coffee. You gave me a small smile and laughed, not in a teasing way, but in a way that made me feel like you thought I had a chance with winning you over. When you left me you left the coffee shop with three other people, I thought I lost my chance with you. You can understand how surprised I was when you asked me out on a date when I saw you walking around our town with the same three people. From the first date that we went on, I knew I was in love with you. The soft look in your eyes made me feel like you loved me too. After dating for a little over two years, I knew that I was taking the biggest risk in my life when I knelt down on one knee and asked you to marry me. You may not have noticed, but the moment you said yes, I could have died happily, knowing that my life was finally complete. You may not have noticed, but when you started hitting me 6 months into our marriage, I was the most depressed I had been. I felt like I truly lost you, and when it continued even after the first year of our marriage, I knew I never really had you. When you were out late into the night, I would watch over our daughter, and see what you once were in her face. It almost drove me nearly insane. Hell, for a period, it did. The day I woke up and saw a man walking down the stairs with you, the guilty look apparent on your face, I had a lapse of judgment. I told you we could work it out. I told you I could become something so much more. You promised to stay loyal, and I promised to become the best version of myself I could possibly be. The next couple of months, I was finally happy again. You were home when I got off of work, and it really seemed like you were getting closer to our daughter. I should have known it was all for show. You were just putting on a show, and secretly stashing away money so you could run away. You told me you never loved me, and that you hated our daughter. You may not have noticed, but our daughter was crying in her crib as you ran out the front door and ran into the night. For the next four days, I took time off of work. I tried being the best father I could be while keeping the house as clean as I could. If you came back, I wanted to make sure that it was the cleanest it could possibly be. The day you finally came back, I couldn’t stay mad at you. It meant you truly loved me. I was ready to forgive you, and the sad look on your face showed me how sorry you truly were. I hugged you, but you never hugged me back. That night you hung yourself. Right next to our daughter’s crib. I woke up to the sight of our daughter playing with your cold feet. That was kinda fucked up, don’t you think? At least have the decency of doing that shit where our daughter couldn’t see. You may not have noticed. Well. No. You definitely noticed how different our town is from everywhere else. You noticed it when a couple of people grabbed you from behind the first time you walked into the cafe. You noticed a voice calling out, “Claimed!” It probably didn’t take you long to realize that voice was mine when we went on our first date. The gag over your mouth and the chain around your arms and legs probably made our dates less fun, but I could swear I saw you smile a couple of times. I could see it in your eyes. The day you said you would marry me with tears falling from your eyes and a knife against your throat, that may not have been the ideal proposal you had in mind, but the result was perfect for me. You may not have noticed, but each hit you gave me while pleading me to let you leave, was the reason why I lost my compassion for you. I thought our daughter would help us get closer, but shit, that’s life I guess. You may have noticed that the police officer that promised to help you escape abused your trust, but hell, like I said, our town is different from the rest of the world. Every time you ran away late at night. There would always be someone there to catch you and return you safely back at our house. Rest in peace, my dear angel. I’m getting ready to go to the coffee shop again. I need to work as well as find my third wife. [X] (",

      "title": "An open letter to my husband",
      "content": "A friend of mine recently bought a second hand laptop from a busy garage sale, the seller said that the thing won't turn on. Being the nerd that he is, my friend got it working and found a strange letter saved on it. He mailed it to me after I asked him if I could share it here. So here goes: \"Dear Matthew, I'm writing to you to tell you that I know everything that you do not want me to know. I know you must dread hearing this- especially coming from me, but I really need you to listen to what I have to say. A few years ago I watched you come home every night smelling of alcohol with your eyes drooling out of their sockets, I waited for you, resolute to see you arrive safely. Yet you never so much as muttered a quick greeting into my direction and you always just went straight to your computer where you started gaming sessions that persisted into early mornings. You even fell asleep at the desk sometimes like an old bum, leaving me isolated in that bed that felt far too big for me alone. I watched you not care about your persona, and I understood it to an extend. Many articles online claim that people tend to let themselves go because they don't expect their partners to lose attraction, and we have been together for 13 years after all. I stomached your disgusting habits and bad odour, because I care for you. You tested my patience a few months ago when I watched you not come home at all until morning and as stalkery as it may sound, I followed you sometimes. Lurking outside the pubs that you entered, I watched through the windows as you took the same seat in the dark corner every night and ordered one beer after the other until you passed out. Bartenders took pity on you 'cause for some reason they never once threw you out. And then last month I followed you again, expecting for your nightly routine to be the same. But it wasn't. There you sat at the bar with your posture more confident than before while you spoke to a beautiful woman seated next to you. Needless to say, you shattered my heart that night and as I sat in the car outside so many questions passed me. How could I have been so stupid as to let things go this far? Your attraction to me had become questionable, but how could I not think to do something about it? You were the person I was meant to spend forever with, but this betrayal made me certain that you were a mistake. I hated you after that, even though I never hated you directly. Through my bitterness I made sure you had only freezing showers when you came home at night, I replaced your fresh sandwiches with rotten ones when I had the chance, I dumped half a liter of cat piss on your side of the bed and I pulled the covers from your body every night. Then the day came that changed everything. You woke up sober and dressed neatly, even went so far as to shave your face and this suspicious behaviour had me trailing you once more as soon as you left the house. I watched from afar as you bought nice flowers and what seemed to be a picnic basket, of course you were preparing to meet her and that was something I didn't want to watch. But something made me follow you still. You took me by surprise as your journey led into the cemetery, I kept my distance as you paused near a grave for what seemed like hours. It took me a considerate amount of time to recognize the tears on your cheeks, 'cause I swear I had never seen you cry before. You left the flowers on the grave and walked away with the basket still in hand. I went home after that, I didn't need to see anymore. I'm in the kitchen as I'm writing this on your laptop and you're in the bathroom. It's nearly 1:30 and that woman I saw you with at the bar is still sound asleep in our bed. But I understand it now, Matthew. Now I know why you're sobbing faintly in the bathroom and why my name stood on that gravestone. I understand and I forgive you, you can stop grieving now and be with that stranger on my side of the bed with a clear mind. Just remember that I'll be near and watching over you as I always had, for once your lifetime ends you'll belong to me again.\" The laptop has refused to turn on after I got this copy.",

      "title": "I am not Sick.",
      "content": "Everyone thinks I’m sick… mentally, I mean. I’m not talking about, like, severe schizophrenia or psychosis or anything like that, but literally, everyone in my life thinks I have a serious eating disorder. I was first diagnosed with purging disorder, and then I was diagnosed with anorexia\\-binge/purge subtype (which makes no fucking sense because I don’t even binge, but whatever, I guess). I rarely eat, but when I do, I almost always make myself puke. I swear on my life it isn’t about losing weight or anything. I don’t hate my body like everyone thinks I do. I have my reasons for doing what I do. Anyway, two weeks ago I was discharged from inpatient treatment. I was admitted with excessively low potassium levels and seriously imbalanced electrolytes. When I went to the hospital I was at a BMI of 14.7 which is severely underweight. After four months of group therapy, meal plans, nutritional supplement drinks, nasogastric tubes, IVs and lots antidepressants, I was finally released at a healthy BMI of 20.3. Everyone thought I was so much better when I got out of the hospital, which would make sense if I were actually sick to begin with, but just days after being discharged from the hospital, I “relapsed” as my psychiatrist puts it. “Danny,” my psychiatrist said, “I know that being a boy with anorexia is tough, especially since there’s a huge stigma surrounding boys with eating disorders, but before we can move on with any treatment. It’s important for you to accept the fact that you’re sick.” Sick\\-\\- I winced at the word, but I kept my mouth shut. “Come on, Danny. Won’t you at least talk to me this time?” She pleaded. “There’s not much else for me to say, doctor. Lane,” I sighed. “I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. I do not have an eating disorder.” The rest of our session was spent with her trying to convince me that I was anorexic, and me adamantly denying it. I don’t see most of my family much. I live with my big sister, Diana. Honestly, the only person who seems to care about me is my big sister. Every day she prepares my meals and is insistent on watching me eat them. She can’t be around all the time, though. Diana’s the lead researcher at a chemistry lab; in other words, she’s a busy woman. On the weekdays, when she isn’t around, I flush the meals that she makes for me down the toilet, or I throw them out the window. I really hate it when Diana gets days off. That means she can watch me eat… force me to eat. Yesterday was one of those days. She barged into my room with a sandwich on a plate and her lab coat still on. She walked up to me and kissed the top of my head. “Danny, honey,” she crooned, “don’t you see that you’re killing yourself? Please eat, hon, just for me.” I shook my head. “Daniel,” she said, taking on a more authoritative tone, “I am not leaving this room until you eat this food I made for you.” Diana really wasn’t lying. We sat there for forty\\-five minutes and she still hadn’t left. My stomach growled loudly. She sighed, “See, Daniel? You’re so hungry. Please just eat.” After more of her pleading, I finally acquiesced. With small, tentative bites, I ate her sandwich. Words like disgusting, wrong, and bad ran through my head as I ate. After finishing the sandwich, I felt sick and disgusting. I had to get the food out of my system immediately. “I’m so sorry,” I said as I ran past my sister and into the bathroom. After shutting and locking the bathroom door behind me, I kneeled in front of the porcelain bowl like it was a deity, and I emptied the contents of my stomach into it. This was my ritual. I heard banging on the bathroom door. “Daniel!” Diana yelled, “you better not be doing what I think you’re doing. Stop it now and come out of there!” I rinsed my mouth and did as she asked. I had already finished purging everything anyway. My poor sister was teary\\-eyed. “Daniel, why would you do that? Why are you hurting yourself like this?” I had a reason for doing what I did. I wasn’t going to tell her my reason, but I did have one. When I was younger, my auntie told me about how she used to be a smoker. Her ex\\-husband hated it when she smoked and would beat her when he found out she had smoked that day. My aunt, trying to be clever, would smoke when he wasn’t at home. Whenever he came home, though, he always knew that she had smoked, and he’d beat her for it. \"Well, how did he know?\" you may ask. Cigarette smoke smells like a motherfucker, and the scent lingered on my aunt. Even though my aunt was desensitized to the smell, her ex\\-husband could always smell it on her. This is the reason why I won’t eat\\-\\- why I can’t eat. Like I said, my sister is a chemist. She’s around chemicals all the time. She probably doesn’t realize that I can smell the formaldehyde she puts in my meals. I’m not sick; I’m just trying to survive.",

      "content": "My wife and I have a four month old son. She woke up early six months ago. I told her it was her turn to check on the baby. I didn't know what else to say. I couldn't tell her he was cold and blue when I checked on him five hours earlier. She didn't say anything to me, just got up and went to his nursery. I kept waiting for the scream. There was none. She simply walked into our bedroom holding his body, still wrapped in his blanket, and sat in bed next to me. She didn't cry. I didn't either. We didn't speak at all. I went to make coffee. She stayed in the bedroom all day. Our son unmoving in her arms. I was making dinner when she finally came out, still holding our son. She had him cradled in one arm, a shovel in her other hand. She looked at me and walked into the backyard without speaking. Neither of us has spoken yet. We fell into a new routine. I make coffee in the morning, she spends the day outside in the backyard. I spend the day at the dining room table. I sit there all day. I can't bring myself to get up until dinnertime. We eat. We silently go to bed. She won't look at me anymore either. We coexist in this strange no contact household now. We eat in silence. The TV stays muted. The only time we are in the same room is when we are eating or sleeping. She came in from the backyard covered in mud today. A mud soaked blanket was cradled in her arms. She looked at me for the first time in 3 months and smiled. Walked into the bedroom silently. I followed her in. She set the blanket down on the bathroom counter and took a shower. I went to bed. I. The morning the blanket was gone and the shovel was leaning against the back door. I was finally ready to talk to her this morning after last night's incident. I spoke for the first time in six months. She couldn't hear me though. She was cold, and blue. A blanket cradled in her arms. I got up and made coffee. I sat at the dining room table until dinnertime. I went back to the bedroom. My wife was still there, unmoving. I unwrapped the blanket in her arms. A small skeleton tucked neatly inside. I went to the backyard and got the shovel. It has been two months since I buried them in the yard. I still have not spoken. I wake up and make coffee. I sit outside in the yard all day. I eat dinner. I go to bed. I put away my son's nursery today. Boxed everything up and put it in the shed outside. I also put all of my wife's belongings away too. The shovel was missing. I woke up today and made my coffee as usual. I went to the backyard and dropped my cup, shattered on the concrete. There was a giant hole in the middle of the yard, with a blanket next to it. I heard someone speak to me from inside. A baby was crying. \"Honey, it's your turn to check on the baby.\"",

      "title": "Pete the Moonshiner",
      "content": "In the fourth and fifth grade, I spent the night at my friend Tom's house almost every weekend. Tom lived in a run-down farm house in the country. He shared a room with his older brother, Walter. The three of us would stay up late telling scary stories. The scariest was a true story. Here is how Walter told it: -0000- Back in the 1920s, this house was owned by a different family. Their closest neighbor was an inbred moonshiner named Pete. He lived in a shack deep in the woods and was frequently in trouble with the law. The parents warned the little boy and girl who lived here NEVER to go near Pete’s land. The young boy lived in this very room. One night, the he was awakened by the sound of shattered glass somewhere inside the house. Living so close to Pete, the boy was very cautious. And instead of opening the door, he locked it. He pressed his ear to the door and listened. The boy heard bootsteps stumbling down the hallway that were much too heavy to be his father's. He could almost smell moonshine through the bedroom door. \"Let me in, boy.\" It was Pete... But the boy wouldn't unlock the door. Overcoming his fear, he shouted \"No!\" After a minute, the boy could hear Pete's heavy boots fading back through the house. In a distant room, he heard his father shouting at Pete. But the shouts soon turned to screams. For almost an hour, the sounds degenerated as the father shred his vocal chords to ribbons while screaming. The boy thought the pleading in hoarse agony was worst thing he had ever heard until it was replaced by something worse. Silence. Pete's boot steps lumbered back through the house to the boy's room. He pounded on the solid oak door. \"Boy! Open up this door or you'll regret it.\" The boy could smell the moonshine through the door. Again he said \"No!\" And so it was his mother's turn. Her shouts and screams lasted for two hours. When they stopped, the heavy boots stumbled back to his door. The stink of moonshine was overwhelming. \"Boy! I said 'Open up this door.' This is your last chance.\" The boy was terrified, \"Please don't hurt my sister!\" Pete was drunk and enjoying himself. He chuckled, \"Then open up, boy.\" But the boy knew better. And so he spent the next three hours listening to the screams of his younger sister. When the police came to investigate the house two days later, they found the mom, dad, and sister tied spread-eagle to their beds. Pete had cut a small hole in each of their lower abdomens and pulled the bowels out of their belly inch by inch as they died in pain. They found the boy dehydrated but alive. He was still locked in THIS very room. Pressed against this very door. He was completely catatonic. He spent the rest of his life in a sanitarium, occasionally mumbling \"should I have opened the door?... should I have opened the door?...\" Pete was eventually caught and executed. His shack was torn down. But his ghost still haunts this house. Sometimes, we can smell a hint of sweet moonshine in the morning, and a pain in our bellies. And when we do, we know Pete was here during the night, trying to pull out our insides. -0000- This story really creeped me out. Like 10 out of 10! I always insisted that the three of us sleep with the bedroom door locked and the lights on. Your imagination is so strong at that age! I was terrified of every noise in the house before finally falling asleep. Whenever I woke at their house, I could even smell the faint, sweet aroma of Pete's moonshine. To be honest, I could usually feel a pain in my lower belly. Whenever I told the two brothers about it, they would giggle and play along. \"Yeah, I smell it too\" said Walter. \"Me too. And my stomach hurts!\" chimed in Tom, pretending to be scared. They moved to Utah when Tom and I were in the fifth grade. I haven't seen them since. Flash forward to this morning. I'm sitting in chemistry lab on campus. As we were setting up the experiment, one of the chemicals smelled exactly the same as my memory of Pete's moonshine. It's an incredibly distinct, penetrating, almost sweet scent - not exactly like hard alcohol or real moonshine, but similar. I had not smelled it since those mornings after sleeping over with Tom and Walter. This was the exact same smell. I picked up the bottle and looked at the label: “diethyl ether.” It was ether. I stared across the lab in a daze. Frozen. I remembered locking the door of their bedroom every night. I thought about waking with the faint smell of ether in my mouth. I remembered the distinct pain in my bowels each morning. And I realized... There was no \"Pete the Moonshiner.\" They had been raping me. Edit: Thanks for gold and your kind words. I blog about my progress at www.ovenfriend.com",

      "title": "My son woke me and night and told me \"there's another daddy in the house.\"",
      "content": "I was gently nudged awake in the middle of the night. I saw my four-year-old son standing in front of me, clutching his favorite bear. He whispered something inaudibly to me. In my haze, I could not quite make out what he said. I said, \"what, buddy?\" And then it became clear. \"There's another daddy downstairs,\" he whispered in that apprehensive way that he does. \"What?\" I said. I heard him, but I could not believe what he just said. \"There's another daddy downstairs. Just like you, but he's angry.\" \"Ok, buddy,\" I said as I lifted him up and set him in bed beside his mother. I pulled the aluminum baseball bat out from behind the bed stand and crept downstairs as quietly as I could. Surely I would have heard someone coming in the house, the alarm system had not gone off. I padded softly as I stepped, hoping my son was having a bad dream. By the time my foot touch the bottom step, I smelled it. I had not smelled it in years, but you never forget it. Single-malt Scotch. The air was pungent with it. I had not drank in four years, but the aroma was unmistakable. Who brought alcohol into this house? I never noticed the creaking hardwood floors before, but they sounded like thunder in an otherwise quiet house. Then I heard the panting. Someone was here. The panting was rage, pure and undeniable. Almost like a dog just after a fight, when he's not quite ready for the fight to be over. I peered around the corner into the dining room from where the breathing was coming. Whatever was breathing was stationary. I gazed around, and even in the darkness I could make out the moonlight splashing on the figure of a man, standing facing a wall. He did not notice me. It stood there, billowing deep, heaving breaths just facing a blank wall. No, wait that wall isn't blank. There's something on it. It's my wife's bridal portrait. The monster is just breathing intense rage at it, and it looks like he's damaged it somehow. I wait for another few seconds for my eyes to adjust. It's clear, he's smeared the word \"whore\" on the bridal portrait. I am now beyond panic. I grip that bat tightly. I'm frozen in between that fight or flight stage. Do I grab my wife and son and run, or do I attack it while it does not notice me? Even if I did attack it, it's so hopped up on adrenaline right now, I don't think I could harm it. In my moment of indecision I finally could make out whoever this is, he does look like me. The decision to fight or run was made for me. It slowly turned and peered over its shoulder at me and says in a haunting, graveled voice, \"I hate you.\" \"Wha-\" I could barely get out, in dismay. \"I. Hate. You.\" it muttered again. \"I hate everything about you. This is your fault. All of it. I hope you fucking die.\" The heart-pounding terror that washed over me was like none I had ever experienced. I finally realized blood was everywhere. Everywhere. It was all over the walls, the floors, his clothes, his hair. It was like he bathed the room in it. \"How dare you marry that fucking harlot. I told you a decade ago this would happen. And now I'm going to kill you.\" It turned and began to come at me. I slammed the door at the bottom of the stairs shut and I could feel him pulling against it. I heard him screaming on the other side like a rabid dog; banging against it with the fury of a pack of wolves. This struggle went on for what seemed like an eternity. Several times I nearly lost the grip on the door handle and then it suddenly stopped. I took a moment to catch my breath. I was too afraid to let go of the door. Whatever this thing was, I didn't want it crawling up the side of the house or trying to sneak into the second-floor window. So in a panic, I dashed upstairs to grab my son. I flipped the light on and saw him covered in blood sitting on my bed, beside my wife whose skull had been bashed in. \"Daddy, you made mommy sick with your bat! Why did you do that?\" The bat were covered in blood and chunks of bone and hair. Blood soaked my shirt and face. What had I done? I was holding the bat in my right hand and something in my left. It was my glass of Scotch.",

      "content": "Right now I'm studying for a test I have tomorrow morning, and as I was studying I got a notification from my school email about a new message in my inbox. I opened it up to find that it was not only from an unknown email that wasn't even attached to the school, but also that it was sent to the entire school. All of the students, faculty, administrators, even the parents were sent this message. This alone creeped me out me out, which only made me more interested in what was typed. So I started reading. This is what it said: =================================================================================================== I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I am so so so so so sorry. For the longest time I've been lying to you all. I've been putting on a mask everyday to school, pretending to be someone else, someone better than who I truly am. In truth, I am a nobody. I have no identity, I have no name, I have no family, I have nothing, I only have this email to leave behind to everyone. I can't sleep at night anymore, it's been keeping me up night after night, fantasizing about this moment, thinking, dreaming, hoping for a day like this to come. And alas, I've been blessed with a reason. A glorious reason to leave this place and never return. I've been telling myself that this moment is the only thing I have to look forward to in my damp, empty, miserable life. I've been suffering in silence for so long, waiting and praying that this fantasy in my mind would come true, and now it has, and I wanted to apologize to you all for it. I want to apologize for any of the stress and anger I have caused everyone around me, although I won't be here to receive your acceptance or denials for these apologies. To my friends, I am sorry. I am sorry for always coming to you when I was at my lowest points. I inconvenienced you, and I pushed all my worries onto you, when you should have pushed all of yours onto me. At least now you won't be bothered by my presence again. To my teachers, I am sorry. I am sorry for my erratic behavior in class. I can't help it. It's swallowed up my true self, dragged it down into the deepest parts of my mind, so much that now I'm an empty, irritable shell of a person, If that's what you'd call me. I hope now you will be at peace, not having to deal with the stupidity and arrogance I've displayed in your classes. I hope they'll be so much better without me. To my parents, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being a failure. I'm sorry for not living up to your expectations, not like there were any for me. You brought me into this world, a failure, and now I will leave this world, still a failure. I truly wish the best for you, and the worst for me. I love you. Now I apologize to all of you, reading this. I'm sorry for wasting your valuable time. I have no time left, so I'll end my long rambling here. I wish I could see all the smiles you all are getting by reading this. I wish I could see the party you'll all throw once I'm dead, dancing to the chant, \"He's dead! Hallelujah!\" just like how I imagined it. You all must be so glad to see me write my last words. I know I am. Once again, I'm deeply sorry for my existence and for being a piece of waste to humanity. I wish I could have done more, however, my life was over once it started. Thank you, and I'm sorry. ​ Sincerely, ​ Jason Everfield =================================================================================================== I'm so confused. Why did it have my name on it? I never wrote anything like that. I've been spending the last hour studying for a test, I didn't write that. I don't know if this is just a prank or some kind of sick joke. Should I be scared, should I run, should I blow it off? I don't know what to do. ​ Hold on, someone's banging on my window.",

      "title": "Do NOT read a book called “Goodnight Precious” to your children.",
      "content": "My son is 2 years old and does. Not. Sleep. So when I saw an ad online for Goodnight Precious: the only book GUARANTEED put your child to sleep, I clicked. I was skeptical -- but there was a video demonstration on the website. “I’m going to show you how this works. Right now, I've got a child in bed.” The goateed man motioned to a 3 or 4-year-old boy lying in bed, wide awake. “I'm going to read the book to him. Watch what happens.” The video cut to him finishing the book. “The sun is set, and you slumber. Goodnight precious, little wonder.” As soon as he closed the book, the boy's eyes fixed straight ahead. Blank. Motionless. Then they fluttered shut. “No wakeups in the middle of the night, either. Once he falls asleep with this book… he stays asleep,” the man said, over the boy's light snores. I was sold. I clicked the order link. In three days, I had the book in my hands. It was a lot thinner than I expected -- only a few cardboard pages. The cover was a drawing of a boy sleeping in bed, as an old woman (maybe his grandma?) watched them from a rocking chair in the corner. I read it to Jackson that very night. “It’s time to go to sleep, little dear. When you wake up, I'll still be here,” I read softly. The illustration showed an old woman tucking a child into bed. She wasn’t smiling. I glanced at Jackson. Still wriggling and wide awake. But he seemed to be enjoying it, at least. “Night has fallen, stars are out. Go to sleep now -- don't you pout.” This image showed the same woman, sitting in a rocking chair next to her sleeping child. “You'll sleep through sadness, sleep through pain. And when it's done, we'll do it again.” That rhyme's really a stretch… I glanced at the image. The woman was getting out of her seat, walking towards her son’s bed. “Go to sleep now, little one. Be patient, now -- we're almost done.” In this drawing, the woman was looking down at her sleeping child from the bedside. She was holding a pillow. I turned the page, to the last one. My heart stopped. The old woman was pressing the pillow over the child’s face. Smiling, with one of those cartoonish grins you often see in kids’ books. I read, in a soft, cautious voice: “The sun is set, and you slumber. Goodnight precious, little wonder.” I closed the book and looked over at Jackson. He was fast asleep. It really works! I moved him to his bed, and enjoyed some well-earned alone time. Who cares if the book is a little weird… it really works! An hour later, I was asleep. \\\\\\ I woke up at 8. Jackson didn't wake me -- at all. A welcome change from the usual. I looked over to his still, slumbering body and smiled. But by 11 AM, he still hadn’t woken up. He never sleeps this late. Maybe he's sick?* I turned on some light music, talked to him. I patted his back. No response. “Jackson?” I said. I picked him up, put him on my lap. His head slumped against my chest. “Jackson? Are you okay?” Nothing. Just his soft, deep breaths against me. “Jackson? Jackson, wake up!” Nothing. I yelled in his ear. I bounced him up and down. I brought him out in the sun. Nothing woke him up. Now, it’s almost 3 o’clock. He’s been asleep for 19 hours. I’m about to load him into the carseat and drive him to the doctor. I think something is terribly wrong with him. BD",

      "content": "I was fourteen when my best friend went away. David told me at a sleepover one night. “So…” he fidgeted. “My mom got a new job. It’s… it’s in California.” He didn’t look up. “That’s 1,913 miles from here. I googled it.” I was silent for a long time after that. “I hear California’s awesome,” I said with a smile. “No snow.” He smiled back. It was really important to make sure he didn’t see me cry. “We should make my last day legendary,” David told me with a conspiratorial grin. He hadn’t told anyone else about his departure yet. He was leaving in the middle of February, so people were going to notice that he was gone. “What if everyone thought that Bloody Mary took me away?” The plan was brilliant. After school, he and I would announce that we would summon the ghost in the mirror, and he’d slip out the window. It was a short reach down to the second-floor balcony, and he would climb onto it, sneak down the stairs, and walk home. I would come out and announce that Bloody Mary had taken him into the Other World, and no one would ever see him again. We all have to leave sometime. Once we accept that, we can control the method. There were at least two dozen people who gathered around the bathroom on that Friday after class. No one had attempted to summon the ghost since Jimmy Fischer tried in the fifth grade, then went home early because he peed in his pants. Jimmy still sat alone at lunch. David and I were barely able to contain our smirks as we went into the bathroom alone. “You know, we should at least try it,” I explained. “That way, we won’t be lying when we say we attempted to ‘bring forth the ghost.’” I said the last four words with mock drama. He blanched just a little. “Um – okay, I suppose so.” I boldly stood in front of the mirror. He tentatively stood next to me. “Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary – I killed your son.” His voice echoed mine, albeit haltingly. We stared into our reflections. We blinked. So did they. Nothing happened. We both let out a sigh of relief. “I’d better get out of here,” David offered. “It’s time.” A hitch of sadness rose in my throat. “Yeah,” was all I could say. He put one leg up on the sink, and one on the open window, before offering me a last goodbye. “See ya,” he said with a smile. He looked down and shifted his weight in order to position himself for the window escape. He was halfway out when I decided that I couldn’t resist. “Boo!” I shouted at him as I jumped forward. His eyes shot up immediately and betrayed a moment of terror. Honestly, I hadn’t meant to make him slip. David fell through the window and out of sight before I could react. ‘Oh great,’ I thought, ‘now we’ll have to deal with a twisted ankle. This will ruin the whole prank.’ I walked over to the window and peeked my head through. David’s head was impaled, sideways, on a metal pole that had once been part of a chain-link fence. He must have fallen fifteen feet. It ran temple to temple. The top of the pole was coated in blood, and the tip of it had brain goop resting on it. His legs were twitching like he was running in place, but the pole held him firm. It wiggled as his legs danced. His eyes darted around wildly as his jaw flapped open and shut, but he was already dead. * I think that Bloody Mary really did get us in the end. At least, that’s what I told everyone. I said that David got spooked at what he saw after the incantation, and jumped out the window. And I see David’s killer every time I look in the mirror.",

      "content": "When I was young, we lived in a bad neighborhood. Our street was in an isolated part of the city. Cheap and dirty, filled with strange and lonely neighbors. One of them was missus Yaga. She was an old lady who lived in the second floor of an old apartment building. Her curtains were always drawn. Across her window was a dark corner of the streets, where street lights did not reach. Every night, I would see her silhouette in front of the window, looking into the dark corner. At dusk I would play out in the streets with my friend, Tommy. We would hang out on the streets in front of my house. One day after sunset, Tommy approached me. I was sitting on the stairs of my building, chewing on an apple. He seemed worried. \"I threw my ball over there. \" He pointed to the dark corner of the street. \"Can you come with me?\" It wasn't that dark. The corner was just a small distance away. \"Why do you need me? \" He looked fidgety \"If I go alone, missus Baba will get me.\" I looked up to her window. The silhouette of a figure on rocking chair was there, staring into the corner. \"The old lady?\" He spoke back in a whisper \"She kills children.\" I must have looked at him in a strange way cause he started to stutter \"You can ask your parents. Or any of the kids. Everyone knows. She killed her own brother when she was ten. \" \"Anyone who goes into the dark corner alone will see her standing in the dark. She'll grab you.\" Tommy looked scared. I looked at him like a younger brother. I couldn't leave him alone. \"Well, come on then.\" I got off the steps and started to walk alongside him. We crossed the road and headed near the street corner. I stopped in front of missus Yaga's house The curtains were still closed. \"Where is it? \" He was scanning the pavement. \"It was supposed to be right here. Did someone move it?\" \"It's over there in the shadow. \" I walked a bit closer \"Wher... did you hear that? \" The curtains were pulled apart. She was standing up. Staring at me with the most unnerving expression. Like she was waiting for something. \"Come on.\" Tommy reached for me. As I watched, her mouth opened in an almost inhuman stretch and let loose a shriek. It was the most horrible screaming I ever heard. She banged on the window, the glass almost cracking. I grabbed Tommy's hand. He tried to tug me back but I pulled him along We ran away. I heard her screaming all along the street following us. Even as I got to my room I heard her outside my bedroom window. She wailed for hours. That night, I stayed up late. I thought about the way she banged on glass. Like she was trying to get out. Late into the night, I heard the sound of glass shattering outside. It was coming down the street. All I could think about was her breaking throigh the window and crawling out. Now wandering the dark, looking for me. I pulled the blankets over my head. But I heard nothing for the rest of the night. The next day I arrived on the streets an hour before dusk. The lights on the second floor were off but I could see it clearly. The second story window was cracked open. I didn't want to stand there anymore. Not in view of the window. I ran off before Tommy showed up. When I got home, my parents were talking in the kitchen. They were speaking in hushed tones. I heard her name. In the night, an intruder broke into missus Yaga's house. They slit her throat. I had to know the truth. I told them about the stories I heard about her. I asked if any of it was true. I learned the real story that night. Ever so often children disappeared in that dark corner. The only witness was the old woman. Everytime, the old woman repeated the same story. When she was young, her brother used to play on the streets. He made friends with a young boy. The boy's name was Tommy. One day her brother disappeared. She said It was Tommy. The young boy led her brother into the dark corner of the street. But Tommy wasn't real. Ever since that day, whenever children go missing, she talked about Tommy. She says the boy led children into the dark corner. She screamed at children to warn them. Dad told me Tommy wasn't real. He's wrong. Every night, just after sunset, I see him outside my window. He's waiting for me to come down and play.",

      "content": "In 1997 a noise was picked up by hundreds of listening stations across the pacific. It was named \"the bloop\". The bloop was an incredibly low frequency and organic in nature. The frequency and patterns of the sound suggested an animal. The only problem was that whatever animal made that sound would have had to be several times larger than a blue whale. It was thought that the bloop was caused by shifting glaciers. But we know better now... I was part of an expedition 700 miles off the coast of Chile. We were locating and tagging local wildlife. Nothing special. We had a deep sea submersible on hand. I was manning the submersible this time. I launched and sank. A couple hours later I reached the sea floor and began buzzing around. Typically on the sea floor you don't see much of anything. It's practically a desert, complete with sand dunes and all. But today I noticed a massive concentration of crabs and other bottom scavengers. It seemed like they were all heading in one specific direction. I requested permission to find out what they were marching to then followed the trail of crabs and isopods. I followed them for roughly an hour before I came to a trench. This trench was relatively small, no where near the size of the Marianas trench. But it was still massive. About a mile and a half long and half a mile wide. At the edge of the trench I saw the crabs and scavengers collecting into clumps around pieces of carrion. Perhaps a whale had died and drifted down here. I went over the edge and into the trench, unprepared for what I would see next. It was massive. It had to be at least 500 feet in length. It was similar to a humpback whale in shape, but it's head was rounder and it's mouth was filled with sharp teeth like an orca's. It's side fins had webbed fingers, like some sort of primordial amphibian. The creature had to be some ancient survivor of a bygone era. At least it used to be. The creature itself was not the most terrifying aspect, however. The creature lay on its side. It's eyes were glassy. I could see swarms of crabs and other deep sea creatures picking at it. As I moved the submersible sideways across the length of the leviathan, I noticed something that gave me chills. The mid section of the beast was torn almost in half. Marks of what were all too obviously left by teeth of staggering proportions were clearly seen. The scars of a titanic struggle. The creature, as incredibly large as it was, had been killed by something much, much bigger. Now I know that \"the bloop\" was not caused by glacier movement. There are creatures out there of biblical proportions. Leviathans in the most literal sense. Only 5% of Earth's oceans have been explored. I fear we are in for a shock at what lies in wait for us when we start exploring the other 95%.",

      "content": "When I say drugs are fantastic, I'm not talking about the designer substances you find in a dark ally. No, I mean the amazing medications invented to cure anything from infections to psychological disorders. The only problem is the excessive restriction on legal drugs. The amount of research, work and potential that gets lost with each denial from the FDA. Just because something doesn't work exactly as intended, it doesn't make it useless. I say this as a person who's always had trouble sleeping. Not in the sense that I can't fall asleep, but rather that I need a whole eleven hours just to feel barely rested; A fact that absolutely does not fly in my line of work. After trying conventional drugs that were aimed at people with narcolepsy, none that proved to be an adequate solution, I had no choice but to turn to the illegal side of things. Think about all the drugs never to reach the shelves at your local pharmacy due to failing to get FDA approval, it's not like their recipes and research just get thrown out. No, there's a whole market for them buried in the depths of the dark web, available for anyone that knows where to look. Of course, it has its risk, and isn't something I'd recommend for your average Joe. I, however, was desperate. Months passed, and I tried numerous different substances, some which helped a little, while others just made it worse. In the end, I landed on a product simply called: Nox. Using a P. O box, the medication arrived within a week. To my surprise, rather than finding a bottle filled with colorful pills, I just received the one, wrapped in a high quality, expensive looking package. Based on the forum I found it on, no one had experienced any adverse effects, so I stupidly ingested it with little hesitation, impatiently awaiting its results. On any given day, I'd be tired around eleven, but with the pill making its way through my digestive tract, I realized that midnight had come and gone, leaving me wide awake. Morning came, and yet I didn't need any sleep. It was great, I got all the work done at a record pace and still had plenty of leftover leisure time. It caused some jealousy at the office, but considering my competitive nature, it didn't bother me in the slightest. Days turned to weeks, then weeks turned to months, and I had successfully eluded the need to sleep. By all logical aspects of biology, my brain should have deteriorated, driving me to the brink of madness, but even a year after ingesting the pill, I remained as sharp as ever. The only thing I noticed was my skin seeming thinner, paler as if I'd fallen slightly ill. I initially fell suspicious of the pill, but my tired looking facade could just as easily be explained by excessive amount of work. It wasn't as if I could stop taking the pills anyway, seeing as I'd only taken the one. That's when I noticed the first “sore.” It looked like an ulcer, a bedsore, but it was situated on my stomach just below the navel. It didn't hurt or anything, so I just put some cream on and waited, but it kept growing. During the next week, patches of skin started falling off, revealing the fat and muscle beneath. It didn't particularly hurt, but it was growing day by day, and it horrified me. I quickly tried to find the site I'd purchased it from, but in the ocean of hidden onions that is the dark web, it had simply vanished, and the link had expired. As far as I could tell, no one, not even the FDA, had ever heard about a pill called: Nox. Over the next few weeks my physical state deteriorated, and the doctors were baffled, yet I remained completely lucid. Even sedation for procedures had no effect on me. Eventually, after months of my skin sloughing off, my heart just stopped... Yet, I couldn't fall unconscious. As I type this, my body is rotting away, and I'm gradually losing function of my arms and legs, and my vision is fading. The only thing remaining is my mind, as wide awake as ever. Once I'm done here, I'm putting a bullet in my brain, but I'm worried that even then, I'll have some sliver of consciousness to keep me awake as they put me in the ground, where I'll lay in darkness forever.

      "content": "He’d wait until everyone was asleep before starting. I’d lie still and feign unconsciousness, but his voice would persist, weakly howling in terrible desperation, as he pleaded with me. Begged me. Implored me to help him take his life. In the garish brightness of daylight, I’d talk to my loved ones about our sleepless nights. The pity on their faces was obvious; so too was the resigned helplessness. They knew there was nothing they could do. All the suffering had to be endured by him, and, by association, me. I was his confidant; the only other person he felt comfortable speaking to. Sobbing to. Screaming to. There was no mistaking the effects the stress had wrought on me. I’d gained weight; I’d gone on disability; I’d grown depressed. Our doctors knew he had problems. They knew something - that was the word they used: something - was wrong with him. They just couldn’t pinpoint what it was. That meant they couldn’t do anything. Last night, we reached a breaking point. For hours, he screamed with impossible, earsplitting power. He regaled me with detailed descriptions about the pain he was enduring. Pain that my inaction was forcing upon him. The screams grew quiet as his energy evaporated. Just like every other night. But rather than sobbing pathetically and begging, his tone grew sinister. His words became violent. “I’ll kill you,” he whispered. “I’ll tear you in half.” My breath caught in my throat. He’d never said anything like that to me before. All the venomous contents of his words had always been directed toward himself. This was new. Terrifying. “You’re going to bleed to death,” he informed me around a series of wracking sobs. “Do you know how you’ll feel knowing you could’ve ended this but didn’t? Knowing you left the girls alone?” The mention of the twins caused me to jump out of bed with rage and indignation. He knew what he was doing. He’d finally figured out what it would take for me to acquiesce. The thought of Dominique and Shonda in foster care because of his hatefulness and my cowardice was too much to bear. Too much for any mother to bear. I started to cry while making the preparations I’d dreaded since the first night he began begging me to take his life. I didn’t say a word to him as I got ready. Every so often, he’d call out and ask what I was doing. I didn’t reply. He was too weak to scream. Too exhausted. All he spoke were pathetic words and phrases like, “please…” and, “it hurts so much.” Words I’d heard over and over and over, but with them now was a sinister element of “or else.” I knew if I did what he wanted, I could be thrown in jail. The twins would be without their mom, just like he’d threatened. But this way, at least I’d be alive. Also, if I was careful, I could get my close friends to help me hide his body. They’d all but said they would in the past - in the darkest moments when I sought their comfort after months of restless nights. By the time everything was set up, he’d realized what was happening. He’d won. I felt sick. Part of me knew I was doing the right thing - that the suffering he’d endured was too much for anyone to have to experience. But another part - a larger part - was doing it for another reason. I wanted him dead. I wanted him out of my life and out of my daughter’s lives and out of the periphery of my friends and extended family. I wanted my autonomy back. We went into the bathroom where everything could be scrubbed clean. Some time later, our eight months of sleepless agony were over. The screaming had stopped. The pleading had stopped. The agony had stopped. Nothing remained but me and his corpse and the blood. Blood in the tub. Blood on my hands. Blood on my thighs. Blood on the coat hanger. More. []( [](",

      "content": "Hi R/Nosleep. I havn't been able to sleep for a while. Sometimes I stay up late. I love my wife, so much. So so much. But, sometimes I stay up late. My wife goes to bed, and I stay up. Redditing or playing video games, or watching T. V... I'd fallen asleep on the couch as I often do, and I awoke to my wife standing over me, crying, shaking me awake. I asked her what was wrong, but for a while she didn't speak. She just hugged me and sobbed. I stroked her hair and comforted her. I wondered if she might have had a dream that I died or something, or if maybe she'd received a text with some tragic news. Finally when she calmed down a little she said \"Let's just sit together for a while.\" \"Do you want to tell me what happened?\" I asked. She seemed to think about it, and decide against it. \"No. I just want to spend some time with you, for a little while.\" \"I'm tired.\" I said, stretching. \"Let's get in bed.\" \"No!\" she almost seemed to shout. \"No. I don't want to go in the bedroom right now.\" I was concerned, but my wife could be a tad eccentric, sometimes even charmingly child like. Maybe going back in there would remind her of a nightmare she'd had? We wound up sitting on the couch chatting. About anything and everything under the sun (except for what had upset her). We played portal. She made coffee, and we snacked on some left overs. We laughed, we reminisced about the early days of our relationship. Before we knew it, it was 7:00am. \"I'm too tired, sweetheart, and I'm sure you are too. Let's get some rest so we don't waste our entire Saturday.\" \"No! We can't! Please!\" She cried. \"Why!?\" I asked \"What's the matter?\" \"We just can't go in there. Please. If we go in, it'll be over.\" She said, her eyes welling up with tears. \"What!? What's in the bedroom?\" (I was really confused. Had she accidentally broken some heirloom, and she was afraid I'd be upset with her?) There was a long silenced as she fought back sobs. Then finally... \"My body is in there! I'm dead, Prakash. I saw my dead body, lying on the bed. Once you see it, it'll be over.\" This was a bit much. Obviously she'd had some nightmare, that she'd believed was real. \"Oh, sweetheart, no. No...it was just a bad dream. Everything is ok.\" I hugged her as she sobbed. \"Look, you're just sleep deprived. You'll feel better when you wake up. I promise.\" She nodded somberly, then walked silently, with me to the bedroom. I gestured to the empty bed, completely devoid of bodies. \"See there? It was a dream. Lay here with me.\" I flopped onto the bed playfully and then propped myself up on my elbow, to chat until we slept. She laid down next to me and closed her eyes. \"So, what had you dreamt?\" I asked. She didn't answer. \"Diane?\" I asked. \"Did you really fall asleep that quickly?\" I laughed. I shook her, and she was stiff. I noticed her lips were a little blue around the edges. Next I noticed she wasn't breathing. Of course I panicked. Of course I called 911. She was only 27 years old. An aneurysm in her sleep. The coroner said she'd been dead for five or six hours before I \"found her body\". I miss her so so much. I hope my promise is kept - where ever she is now, where ever she woke up, I hope she feels better.",

And when I married my first wife, the only things with wings were natural, with airplanes far in the future. I fought the first world war with grey hair, and I watched the second one pass with a cane in my hands. By the time the nuclear bomb had dropped, I’d thought I’d seen it all, and that soon I’d be joining the fallen soldiers in the afterlife. I was wrong. And I found that out on the day my wife died, in 1947.

From the back of her grey hair, I could almost pretend she was still alive. And for an hour I did, my eyes welling up in tears as I realized that without her, my life was no longer worth living. So I walked to my dresser, and I reached into the top drawer, my wrinkled hands searching towards the back, shaking as they found the cold metal wrapped in old rags. And pulling out the loaded revolver, I made my way back to my bed, slipping back on the covers. Laying next to my wife, this time forever. Raising the gun to my temple, I felt no hesitation. I was done here on earth, finished. My purpose complete, and with the failing of my physical and slowing of my mental facilities, I’d prefer to die than deteriorate. I was almost excited to pull the trigger. And when I did, I was met with only one sound. Click. I frowned, checking the cylinder to make sure each of the slots had a bullet. A dud, I thought, and raised the gun again. And once more I pulled the trigger. Click. Click, click, click, click, click, click- one for each of the bullets, all of them failing their duty. So I moved on to the medication the doctors had prescribed to me in my final years, downing several multiples of their recommendations until darkness overtook me. But then I awoke in my own vomit, the remains of medication strewn over my bed, and my body weakened but still very alive. At my wife’s funeral, I decided to let nature run its course. To wait for death the typical way, until old age claimed me. But then a decade passed, and another, and another. Every few months I attempted suicide once more, but each time failure awaited me. Jumping off a bridge onto concrete yielded broken bones, but no death. Drowning only resulted in me awakening face up and sputtering on the shoreline. Suffocating myself always ended in an unexpected leak where fresh air was able to enter, and revive my starving cells. No reputable scientist believed my claims. Nor did doctors, though often perplexed. And every year more of me deteriorated- I lost a foot to diabetes, the nerves on my right hand failed, my eyes have long lost their once sharp vision. By the eighties I was completely deaf, by eighty five I could no longer stand, and by the early two thousands my thoughts came slow but still conscious. Simply writing this took three weeks, my focus waning in and out, my misspellings so frequent that my friend could barely transcribe this passage. And it wasn’t until just last week that I finally heard a scientific explanation of what was occurring to me, explained by the same friend who transcribed this for me. That there was a theory in science that stated that so long as there was a chance for someone to stay alive, that they would stay alive. That due to infinite possibilities in infinite univerces, there will always be a version of me that never dies. That though 99% of the universes with me in them die with every suicide attempt, only the 1% of the times where I survived mattered. Because so long as there was a sliver of a chance that I could be alive, there was a version of me that would be alive. That because I’m only conscious in the universes where I’m alive, none of the other universes mattered. That they collapsed somehow, that they didn’t matter. Though I don’t quite understand it, he assured me that this theory, quantum immortality, could be very real. And with my age as proof, that it is real. What’s terrifying for you is not that I’m experiencing immortality. It’s that you will too, but you won’t know until the years slip by and death never claims. Especially since the universe that you will experience this is astronomically not likely this one, so you never have read this. You won’t know until it happens. And you can’t escape.

      "title": "I tipped my Uber driver $20 - I hope it was enough",
      "content": "Not sure where to post this but here goes... Last night I was working late so I took advantage of my company's guaranteed ride home program for overtime works and called an Uber. I was initially surprise when my driver pulled up in an unexpectedly nice vehicle - a Mercedes GL 450. I don't Uber that much,but when I do I don't think I've ever gotten anything other than a Prius. This was next level. There was bottled water, chargers for every type of phone, and even some snacks. I actually checked my app to make sure I didn't request an Uber Select or something by accident. But it was just ordinary Uber X. I was thinking maybe I got lucky. The driver was an Asian girl. Chinese maybe. I know there is a stereotype that westerners can't tell the age of Asians but I honestly couldn't say if this woman was in her early 20's or early 50's. She had that timeless fresh Asian look - like that actress from Agents of Shield. She was very pretty, but there was something anomalous about her and Uber driving and this car. Normally I don't make chit-chat with my Uber drivers, but it was a 45 minute ride home and after half an hour in silence the overall oddity of the situation eventually overcame my reluctance. \"This is a really great car\" I tried. The woman smiled. \"Thanks, I like it to.\" I was racking my brain for a follow-up but everything that popped into my head sounded like I was some kind of stalker. There was another few minutes of silence before I tried again. \"So how do you decide to be an Uber driver?' \"Oh, it's kind of a long story.\" she responded. \"We have some time I think.\" The woman looked at me in the rear view mirror. Her eyes were incredibly piercing, as if she was taking measure of my soul. Then she turned back to the road. \"Actually, originally my husband was an Uber driver. He was a profesisonal driver in China, which was a high-status job, working for government officials and high-profile foreign visitors. When we immigrated here, he got his commercial license and signed up with Uber. He drove Uber Black and only had commercial clients. Business was good, and he bought this car for that.\" \"Oh - that's cool\" I added. I wasn't sure where this was going. \"But when Uber got popular, there were more drivers. And then they introduced Uber X. Then anyone could drive. You didn't need a commercial license or anything. You didn't have to be a professional driver at all. \"For a while it was still OK, but over time there were fewer and fewer requests for the high-end Ubers. He thought he could make it up in tips, but at first Uber didn't have tipping. And even when they added it, most people still didn't tip. No one cared about the quality of service or the professionalism. On top of not tipping, people were so disrespectful. They would get the car dirty, come in with their dirty shoes or reeking of cigarette smoke. And worst of all, people would downrate him for no reason - just if they were having a bad day or maybe they just didn't like Chinese. It was humiliating for him. \"His income kept going down, until eventually he couldn't even pay for our house. We had to move into an apartment, and even then it was a struggle. Eventually, he was so ashamed that he took his own life.\" I was stunned. I didn't know what to say. I was wishing I had just kept my mouth shut. Luckily we were almost home. \"That's really tragic. I'm so sorry for your loss.\" \"Since his passing, I've taken over for him, driving on his account. I go out of my to provide the best possible experience. And then, if a passenger still gives me a bad rating or no tip, I remember them. I know where they live or where they work. And later, I make them pay what they did to my husband.\" I was still processing the full import of this when the car came to a stop in front of my house. \"Here you go! I hope you had a good trip.\" I thanked her and carefully exited the vehicle. As I entered my house, she drove away. My Uber app pinged in my pocket, asking me to rate my driver. My entire body when cold with fear. I gave her 5 stars and $20. I hope it was enough. ​",

      "title": "I made a dummy account to catch my husband’s infidelity.",
      "content": "My (28F) husband (30M) thought he was doing great in hiding his cheating, but I know him to well not to notice. I’m not here for sympathy, I’m here to ask for help. He started becoming overprotective of his phone, and going out every night at 1am. I always pretend to be asleep and wait till he comes back, and every time he does, he’s wearing something different, he smells of perfume, and he always takes a bath before coming back to bed. Sometimes, I would find a strand of hair on his coat, or a lipstick in his car, or worse, a wallet. I made no advances, because we were happy. We had the perfect husband-wife relationship, our parents love us both, no family drama, nothing. I didn’t want to ruin it just because my husband was probably getting sick of me. But, he found out. I had my eyes open when he suddenly came back earlier than usual; 3AM. He was usually back by 5 or 6AM, so at the time, I was just doing my best to stay awake. It felt like I was the one doing something wrong, like I was the one caught cheating, but he asked for forgiveness. Begged for it, even. He said it would never happen again. He said it was just a fling. So I said okay. We had a serious talk about it, and we both promised to put this behind us. But… I couldn’t. A few weeks after, I made a dummy account out of my old one; one he hasn’t followed or heard about. I wanted to make it so the account wasn’t too new, and posted some pictures I got online. To my demise, he bit the trap. He was flirting endlessly to the woman I created and even asked for some pictures. I asked if we could meet. I shouldn’t have. Now, I’m hiding in my car, watching as my husband prepares what only seems like a stash of a psychopath. He had everything. Chainsaws. Knives. Daggers. Katanas. I had no plans of going out. I was not about to be fucking killed by my husband. But then, by some miracle, some woman walks by and flirts with my husband. She looks exactly like the woman in the pictures, or maybe it was because it was night. They hit it off, and the woman rides in his car. As soon as they go, I speed my way to our house. I didn’t care about the red lights I passed through, all I wanted was to lie down and sleep and forget. But as soon as I got home, my body went cold. There. he. was. He was holding the woman’s… head. My eyes scanned for a body, only to see it in the kitchen. “Took you long enough to catch me, honey.” He calmly walked to the kitchen, humming a tune that I swear came from The Conjuring. I ran, and I’m hiding in our bedroom. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to feel. I think I’m still in shock. Help. Please. He’s knocking. “Darling, wife, come on out now. I promise I didn’t make a mess.” Edit: Hi, just an update! I’ve scrolled past your comments and realized you guys were right! He didn’t cheat, and the opposite at that, so I went out of the room that night. He begged for forgiveness, which was something I really didn’t expect. One thing though, I did explain to hin that he may or may not have killed the wrong person and told him that I was the one behind the stupid account. He said it was fine (surprisingly, this conversation went on casually as if we were talking about what food to eat for dinner) and that he’d just drive far away to throw the woman’s remains. Yes. Remains. While I was having the worst breakdown of my life in our bedroom, he had already put the woman in SEPARATE BAGS (this was a lot to take in especially because there was not one speck of blood on the floor or the wall. And, uhm, well, during the 5 days that I didn’t put an update, we were out… hunting. I won’t go into further details, but I kind of get why he does it. How it feels. How my blood rushes whenever they try to run – crawl away. Thank you for all your support, because now, I have one very loving husband, and… the last time I counted there were 4 bodies here. I’m not sure, but, yeah! Also, to that one person that told the authorities, Keep your doors locked.",

      "title": "The delay on my TV is starting to worry me…",
      "content": "Well, I’ll start by saying delay is not the correct word. I don’t know what the right word is- it seems more that my television is ahead of time. It started small, as these situations always do. My TV was showing programmes 1-2 minutes before they were estimated to air. It wasn’t much, I barely noticed till I was watching the news. They did the typical morning announcement of ’It’s 7 am…’ and my phone showed it as 6.57 am. Like I said, hardly anything to think about. Over the next few weeks, with me leaving for the office at the 7am mark according to my TV, it became more obvious. I was arriving to work 5, 10, 15 minutes earlier than normal. By the time I decided to investigate, it was 25 minutes out. Don’t get me wrong, I tested this out. I got the old TV out of the spare room and plugged it in next to the new one, put them on the same channel and watched. I had my phone playing the same channel via the channel live website stream, and it was always ahead. No matter what I compared it to, it was always ahead. It was useful for a while. Before heading to work one day, it told me there was an accident on the road I normally use through town. I went around it that morning, and sure enough, shortly into my journey I heard the news of a crash on that exact road. The hold up was keeping people stuck for over an hour. I’d use the traffic report often, but after a while I realised I could watch the horse racing and would have time to book in the winner before the race had even started. I was getting a tidy income from this. It was almost obsessive- switching channel at just the right time, with my bet placing app open and ready to go. The money was a big help, but after a while my account was shut down. Apparently, after a month-long winning streak, they became ‘suspicious of my online activity’. But thats beside the point. I’m writing here because I’m becoming concerned about what I’m seeing. It’s been about five months since this started, and my TV is just under eight hours ahead. I turned my TV on, ready to hear what my journey to work would be like the next morning, when a picture of my face appeared. It seems that tomorrow, I go missing. At first it was reported that I was taken into a white windowless van on my way into work. I emailed my manager telling him I wouldn’t be in tomorrow, when the news story had another break. The new evidence shows it was possible I was taken from my home. I started packing my bags to get to my sisters house- she only lived a few hours drive away- but as I was heading out the door, the report changed again. It has been two hours since I saw the initial report, and apparently at 8.45am tomorrow, my body would be found, outside of my sisters town. I don’t know what to do- I dropped my bag and turned the TV off. I have five hours till I’m meant to be abducted, and seven till my body is meant to be found. If you know what’s happening to me, or if you know why, please tell me. I don’t know what to do.",

      "content": "Every person has at least one distinct moment that fucks up the rest of their life in some small way. That moment can never be un-fucked, and that person will never again see the world in quite the same light. Howard Phillips served the best seafood in Boston, Massachusetts. The calamari had a cult following, but its crab was second to none. At $19.13 for a whole, fresh, deep-fried, soft-shell crab, it was nothing short of a steal. It was decadence incarnate, with neither spritz of lemon nor dab of sauce needed to detract from its buttery cascades of flavor. Paired with a dry German Riesling, the taste lingered in a way that transcended culinary excellence and entered Zen-like satisfaction. No one noticed the tiny droplet of spittle fall from my lips as the dish was placed before me. And after the first crunch, I noticed no one else. I was nearly unaware that I had consumed half the crab. My hand had been floating to my lips of its own accord, completely detached from the conscious discretion of my brain. It took several attempts for the waiter to get my attention. Sweat covered his bald forehead. “Sir!” he insisted as loudly as possible without attracting even more attention from the nearby guests. “Sir! I need to speak with you, please!” I swallowed. “Yes?” I was annoyed. With my attention fully given, he seemed at a loss. “Um.” He swallowed. “It seems, sir, that one of our staff was upset with a recent online review that you gave concerning our calamari.” He breathed deeply. “The employee – who is being dealt with! – chose to, ah, express his frustration in a most unprofessional manner.” I looked at him in confusion as my hand reached for another forkful. “Sir, stop eating.” I was shocked. Then I followed his eyes to my plate. I remembered that the first bite had been crunchy. It shouldn’t have been crunchy. The deep-fried crab was supposed to have eight legs. But two of those should have been claws. This crab had no claws. Just eight legs. Then it twitched. Though deep-fried, my dinner was not dead. Nausea attacked like a fucking hurricane. But instead of bile, I felt a solid object rise from my throat. Its hairy, bristly legs raked my uvula as it burst forth between my teeth. Those tiny little hairs fucking hurt. It caressed my tongue as it tumbled from my mouth and landed on the plate with a soft clunk. My stomach had dissolved the breading, revealing the true nature of the meat beneath. The long, black leg of a spider – which had just been in my stomach – jittered on my plate. “It seems, sir… that the man sought revenge. He wanted to hurt you, to horrify you…” he gulped. “So he acquired a tarantula and deep-fried it instead of a crab.” I puked my dry Riesling onto the plate with a splorch. “I’m so sorry, sir.” The uneaten half of the tarantula was in full squirm, mindlessly pushing itself around the spunk-filled plate. The tiny, razor-sharp hairs were now poking through the breading as it flaked off and dissolved in the Riesling puke. Its four remaining legs slowly waved at me like half a hairy hand. I wanted to faint and never re-awaken. Only a sense of fury kept my consciousness going. “Well!” I shrieked, ignoring the increasing shock of the guests around us, “Are you going to call an ambulance?” “Ah, don’t worry, sir,” he responded, relieved. “You will be fine. The FDA allows a certain amount of arachnid parts in food. In fact, you consume spiders all the time. The only thing different about today is that you’ve seen how it happens.” BD",

      "content": "Hi, Audrey You don't know me at all (except that I just recently deposited a few hundred bucks into your account after you promised me a fantastic package for a work from home opportunity). I felt so silly once I realised that I was scammed and tried so hard to reverse the payment and get some of my money back. A futile process, in retrospect, but what did I expect, right... Anyway, Audrey, I had your bank account details and I felt very tempted to just give out your banking details in an elaborate scam but I figured karma will sort you out eventually. However, I couldn't just wait for karma and not be there to witness your punishment. You don't know this, but I used to work in prison. Dangerous people, you know, but all very willing to return favours if you help them inside prison. A cigarette here, early parole report there. Quid pro quo. Oh, it was like destiny when one of my 'old friends' rang me up from outside prison to thank me for the parole report. Of course I had to ask for a favour in return. Prisoners and parolees are very resourceful, you know. He told me you're a mother of three beautiful little girls, working two jobs to make ends meet (I understand that scamming business now). I still have the news report where your daughters were declared missing. You were so scared. You promised a lot of money for any information about their whereabouts. You plead for their safe return. I wanted to collect that money, but then I would have had to explain how I got all of this information and I'm not prepared to lie to the police for a reward. I'm an honest person, I work hard for my money. Unlike you. So I left you the note to tell you they are safe. You looked relieved. Now, Audrey, before you take the note to the police, you need to understand that your children are safe; no harm will ever come to them ever again. You will find some more information in the mail a little bit later. You took my last money, Audrey. I couldn't buy food. I couldn't pay my bills. I had to let my son go to school without a proper lunch for a week. Thankfully, I managed to reconnect with yet another 'old friend'. He is also very resourceful and owed me a favour for when he needed a few items to sell in prison. The baby didn't feel anything. She was fast asleep when he injected her. My son was overjoyed when he saw a decent dinner that night. We managed to get buyers for your middle child's (Anna, right?) organs. A lot of money in young childrens; in case you want a different kind of scenery for your next scam. The oldest one, oh, she is very pretty, is already living with a new family. They promised to take good care of her. She'll be fed, clothed and she gets to start earning her own allowance straight away. Every day. I hear there are quite a few gentlemen who will pay good money for her company. I've arranged for her first check to be paid to you because you obviously need the money. Lastly, I feel like I should say thank you for this opportunity. I will be more aware of scammers like you but I have also reconnected with a lot of old friends. Sincerely, Victim 102698",

      "title": "My husband left me a note",
      "content": "The floor was strewn with construction paper, glue sticks, and glitter. In the center was Emma, her hands on a pile of jagged, misshapen hearts. “You should make a Valentine for Daddy,” she said. “Daddy and I don’t really do… handmade valentines cut out of construction paper.” And I had too much on my mind for stupid crafts. Jack was mad at me – Cat, I’m supposed to get a call from a very important client. Don’t nag me! And where was mister. Whiskers? If he ran away again – “Why not?” Emma said, her scissors cutting wildly into the paper. “It’s more of a kid thing, honey.” Her face grew red, and she smeared the glitter with newfound ferocity. “I’m not a kid! I’m eight years old! Eight!” No, no, please don’t have a tantrum. I rushed to pick up a piece of construction paper. I froze. Underneath were several small pieces of paper. I turned them over, and began to read. As expected – they were notes from my husband. He constantly left notes around the house, whether it was to warn us about the broken toilet seat or to tell us he loved us. The handwriting was much sloppier than usual, but still legible. Together, they said: CAT I ALREADY GOT THE CALL. I’LL KNOW IF YOU PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN IN THE BASEMENT WITH MINE. TONIGHT, I WANT YOUR BODY I blushed, and grinned, and even suppressed a giggle. He’d been complaining, recently, how we were always glued to our phones, how we never interacted with each other… I didn’t realize he was talking about sex! And what a romantic idea – to lock away our phones, and have the night all to ourselves, without any distractions… “Mom, what’s that?” “Nothing,” I said, stuffing the notes into my pocket. “Uh, I’m going to look for mister. Whiskers, okay?” When Jack finally climbed into bed, I curled up against him. “I’ve been looking forward to tonight,” I said, in the best sultry voice I could muster. He smiled at me. “Yeah? Why’s that?” I let my hair brush against his neck, the satin chemise touch his back. “I got your note.” “My note?” “The one you left me in the dining room.” My fingers trailed up his leg, but he yanked it away. “What are you talking about?” Annoyed, I stood up, picked up my jeans, and fished for the note. “This one,” I said, throwing the crumpled pieces of paper onto the bed. He eyed me cautiously, then picked up the notes – and frowned. “Cat, I didn’t write this.” “Who did, then?” I said, my voice growing louder. “A ghost?” Shuffling the pieces in his hands, his eyes grew wide; his frown grew deeper. “I think you read them in reverse order.” “So?” He stepped forward. In the dim light, he was white as a sheet. Hands shaking, he laid the pieces of paper on the nightstand. I walked over, my heart pounding, and read them slowly: TONIGHT, I WANT YOUR BODY IN THE BASEMENT WITH MINE. PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN I’LL KNOW IF YOU CALL. I ALREADY GOT THE CAT “We need to call the police,” he said, grabbing at his pocket. “Wait – where’s my phone?” I backed away, staring at the floor. “Cat? Where’s my phone?” My heart pounded, and I heard ringing in my ears. “I put our phones in the basement.”",

      "title": "My Daughter had been trying to warn me for weeks. I really should have listened.",
      "content": "\"Daddy… I think there's a monster in the attic!\" I gave my daughter a tired smile. It was the best that I could do at this point. She'd been doing this for weeks now. Every night I'd come and tuck her in, switch the night light on and kiss her goodnight when she would pull the blanket tight under her chin and tell me about the monster living in the attic of our house. Eyes wide, lips quivering, she would shake her little head furiously and insist that she could not possibly go to sleep until I got up and checked. It wouldn't matter how much I tell her that it's all just in her head, and that monsters aren't real - if I don't check the attic, she'd wake up screaming and crying just past midnight. Every single time. It's not like her fears were completely baseless, as we had all been hearing odd skittering noises coming from up there at night. Probably rats. No monster is that light-footed. \"Please Daddy. Could you go and check?\" She whispered, afraid that the thing upstairs would eavesdrop and get mad at her request. \"Okay.\" I replied. There was no harm in indulging this little quirk of hers for at least a little longer. After all, the day when she would stop asking me to check for monsters and slam the door shut in my face wasn't all that far away. I just wished it wasn't the attic though - why can't the damn thing live in her closet like a normal monster? Like a bored robot carrying out its daily task, I trudged out of her room, yawning as I reached the attic door, before sliding the ladder down and climbing up, one rickety rung at a time. I popped my head into the cramped space, slipped my phone out of my pocket and turned on its flashlight. Motes of dust shivered in the pale glow cast by the phone which illuminated the attic. Cardboard boxes covered in tattered rags, my wife's old easel and some broken furniture filled up the tiny attic. But no monsters. \"Alright honey.\" I said after coming back down to my daughter's room. \"I've checked. No monsters again tonight. Maybe we'll find them tomorrow.\" She grinned, relieved. \"Thank you Daddy.\" \"Goodnight love.\" \"Goodnight.\" Groaning and rubbing the crick in my neck, I entered our bedroom and plopped down on the bed belly-first, mushing my face into the pillow. \"Is Daddy back from fighting monsters?\" My wife asked, slight mirth dancing in her tired voice. I grunted. \"Yep. Kicked its little ass and sent it scurrying back to hell.\" She chuckled, and then turned over to the other side, her back facing me. I shut my eyes and got ready to go to sleep, when I was rudely interrupted by the critters in the attic skittering around like kids hopped up on candy. Fucking bastards with their little rat paws slapping against the wooden flooring of the attic. \"Babe. You really need to get rid of those rats.\" I nodded, then realised she couldn't see me. \"Yeah. Tomorrow.\" \"You've been saying that for a while now. They are really starting to irritate me…\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll get it done. Tomorrow.\" She sighed and shrugged her shoulders. Soon her breathing slowed down as she fell asleep. I wanted to follow her into the dreamworld but my stiff neck wouldn't allow me to do so. I tossed and turned, before finally realising I would have to lie on my back if I were to have any shot at catching some sleep, and I hated doing that. I hadn't slept on my back in ages. But the ache in my neck forced me. And then that damn skittering again. Fuck. I rubbed my forehead, wiggled my shoulders and opened my eyes. And saw who, no, what had been making that noise for all those weeks. Up on the ceiling, I spotted a figure. White, but hidden by the dark. I froze. What the fuck? It shifted. And there was that sound again, like claws scratching wood. My heart beat faster and my body erupted in sweat. What the fuck. What the fuck. Hands trembling, I reached for my phone and gently swung it around, shining the light on the figure on the ceiling. The light fell upon a face. Old. Wrinkled. Framed by matted locks of white hair that flowed down like the aerial roots of an ancient tree. It was an old woman, dressed in white, leering down at me, her fingers digging onto the wood of the ceiling. I gasped, and the grinning woman turned and crawled out of the room, moving across the ceiling like a fucked up spiderwoman, before disappearing into the hallway outside. I jumped out of the bed and ran out into the hallway, letting my eyes scan each and every inch of all the walls outside. But there was no one there. It was like she had disappeared. I would have almost believed that I had dreamt it all up if I hadn't noticed the long claw marks on the ceiling and felt my stomach drop. And that's when I finally understood. That for all those weeks that we had been hearing those sounds - it wasn't some rats skittering around. It was that woman, looking down on our sleeping bodies. Watching. Grinning. M",

      "content": "Part 2: Part 2: Part 3 Part 4 Next Chapter When most people think of demon possession they picture the classic projectile vomiting, head spinning around variety. While that does happen, it's mostly novice demons who cause that, the vomiting and abnormal behavior being a result of the host's mind rejecting the possession. In reality, most demon possessions are a lot more subtle. They're the little voice that tells you that you're fine to drive when you know you've had too much, or that you can cheat on your wife just this once and no one will ever find out. Or, if you've ever known someone with Alzheimer's who got really mean towards the end, you're like as not looking at the work of a demon. Dementia demons are mostly newbies though. They do it because old broken minds don't fight back, so it's pretty much impossible to screw up. And if you're in hell you want good stats on your first possession, otherwise you'll get kicked right to the back of the line and you won't see another chance for thousands of years. Oh yeah, the line. Everybody in hell gets a number in the line, and the more evil you do with each possession, the better your place in line. So if you're lucky enough to get a possession, you'd better wreak havoc, and try not to get exorcised or killed. It used to be hell trying to keep track of the paperwork of who went where, but things are running a lot more smoothly with the new computer system. We're still way behind earth technology of course-we don't get a lot of computer engineers down here for some reason. We've got plenty of salespeople though. But before you can even hop in the line, you've got to go through what basically amounts to demon college. They call it a college but it's really more like those corporate training seminars they have in America. Satan wanted it to be soul crushing after all. Most of the introductory stuff is boring, like how to take control of the mind of your victim. That really is the foundation for everything though, because if you can't do that your victim's mind will kick you right out and you'll be back in hell, at the back of the line with a failure of possession charge on your record. And you definitely don't want that. The advanced stuff is where it gets more interesting, and you get to choose a specialty. Most people go into Addiction, because it's one of the easiest majors and you get a reasonable amount of time before your host OD's or just gets used up. Some people go into Mental Illness, but that can get you institutionalized, and you don't really get to have fun with your new body if you're stuck in a padded room all day. There's also a dictator class-Professor Hitler teaches that one. But not many people take it. Not only is it impractical, Hitler always ends up going on some tangential rant about Jews at the end of class. We get it Hitler, you don't like Jews. Professor Bundy's class is pretty popular though. There are a lot of wannabe serial killers in hell, and it gives amazing stats if you can pull it off on earth. Ten or more victims and you're allowed to jump the line and possess another body without going back to Hell first. The last thing you should know about demon possession is how it happens. After all, you wanna avoid it if you can. The most common is Ouija board use. People will accidentally summon up a demon , and by letting it control their hands they allow their consciousness to overlap. The demon sneaks in through that window. If it's a particularly talented demon it can fragment its consciousness and possess everyone with their hands on the board. The same thing can happen with séances. Most demons will choose the weakest link, but some will be able to possess everyone in the room. Anyway, I'm afraid this is where my story ends. My host body is dying and typing is getting pretty exhausting. But before I leave you there's one more thing I want to tell you. The most ancient and skilled demons only need a tiny overlap in consciousness to possess you. They may only need to converse with you for a moment, or even just trick you into reading something that they've written. Maybe a story that distracts you just long enough for them to slip in unnoticed. You may feel uneasy or paranoid when it happens, or you may feel nothing at all. How do you feel now?",

      "content": "I'd only been gone for about fifteen minutes, sneaking in a coffee break in the early morning hours. By the time I returned, panic had spread through the office like wildfire. “James, what's going on?” I asked, more confused than worried. He didn't have to answer. Instead, he just pointed at the windows. They had been covered in black, semi-transparent plastic, locking us in from the outside world. “The CDC, they've locked us in. Apparently someone's infected?” he half asked, half stated. It had only been an hour since we all enjoyed a company provided, bagel breakfast. Spirits had been high, and we were ready to work. Now suddenly, we were literally prisoners. Through the plastic, we could see armed guards patrolling the building. All dressed in black uniforms and gas masks. “They can't just lock us in here without warning. Did you call the police?” I asked. He nodded, “yeah, all calls just get directed to their office. Fuck, man, my wife is sick at home, I can't get stuck here!” While we speculated, our supervisor called us into the meeting room. “Listen, I just talked to their director. They're going to contain the situation, and let us out. As far as we know, it's all a huge misunderstanding. I haven't seen as much as a sniffle here in weeks,” he said, clearly faking optimism. “But if you're feeling sick, or see anyone displaying symptoms, please let us know.” What followed was a barrage of questions and protests. But it was a fruitless effort. Regardless of how much we wanted out, we couldn't even get through the doors, much less fight an army. They started counting heads, and quickly realized that one of us had gone missing. “Has anyone seen Leonard?” our boss asked. “He went to take a leak... an hour ago,” James said. “I'll go... I'll go check on him.” I joined him, and the two of us went to check on Leonard. As we opened the bathroom door, we were immediately hit with a metallic stench. I almost puked as I saw him, sitting in pool of his own blood, clutching onto a kitchen knife. “I tried to get them out, but there's too many of them,” Leonard said weakly. He'd cut off chunks of his own arm, and strewn them across the floor. We dove down to grab the knife away from him, at which point I noticed long, thin bits that looks like worms, covering the floor. “No, stop it! I need to cut them out! You're killing me!” he yelled. “Wha – what are those?” I stuttered. “Worms?” James asked. At a first glance, that's what they looked like. But, after a minute, it dawned on me that the things Leonard had cut out, were his own veins. “I have to get them out!” he sobbed. I tried to wrap my belt around his bleeding arm, creating a make-shift tourniquet. Unfortunately, it wouldn't stick, and before we got a chance at stopping his profusely bleeding limb, he died. We didn't even have time to process anything, before we were interrupted by a horrified scream. We rushed back to the office, only to see one of our coworkers desperately try to smash the glass door. Once she'd made a sufficiently large hole, she started dragging her arms against it, cutting them to shreds. We couldn't save her in time... One by one, the office workers fell to insanity. Each begging to remove the alleged worms inside them. We tied down those we could, but with people constantly falling victim to the same fate, we could do little but hide ourselves away. From our office, we witnessed the sick cut their own flesh away. They tore their arteries, tendons and nerves out, quickly dying from blood loss. All the while, we just watched. By the next morning, more than half the staff had succumbed to self sustained wounds. Not a single one of us dared interrupt, lest we ourselves get infected with the psychosis. At 10:42 AM, the CDC finally contacted us again. They'd isolated seven clusters of infections around the city. The disease, which caused severe psychosis by literally destroying the brain, was thought to be caused by rapidly acting prions. All of it stemming from meat, bought from a local pastry shop, that specialized in bagels. There's no cure, but the CDC promised to let us out, once the infection had been contained. At least they're letting us contact our loved ones. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll make it out of here... Just an hour ago, my skin started itching. At first, I just ignored it, but then I felt the things crawling under my skin. It hurts, and I can't ignore it any longer. Incessant... pulsating... agonizing... worms... they don't belong... I need to get these things out of me, no matter what it takes. TCC",

      "title": "I found a secret radio station",
      "content": "No one uses radio anymore, let's face it. We still listen to one or two stations for car ride music, but that's it. No one gets their news or entertainment from radio shows. That's exactly what I was thinking when I got a portable radio last Christmas, but of course I was too nice to say it. \"Thank you so much,\" I said slowly, trying to think of something to add. \"You know I like music.\" Strangely enough, that radio was all I had for entertainment when my internet went out last weekend. I don't know why I kept the radio that long, really. I turned the dial lazily. I was bored out of my mind, laying on my bed and holding the radio above me with my arms extended. There were hardly any stations even broadcasting. Staticky country music, boring. Christian music, I got enough of that every Sunday. Boring. Basketball game, not interested. When I turned it again, a little past 70 I believe, I heard a noise so jarring that I rolled over and set the radio down. It was followed by a little jingle, a section from some old waltz song. The static distorting the song and the out-of-tune piano sound put a feeling of discomfort somewhere in me, but I couldn't exactly place where-- or why. It was creepy, in an innocent but menacing way, like a music box in a horror movie trailer. I didn't like it, but I was too curious to turn the radio off. The jingle was followed by a few seconds of dull noise, just cracking static. Then there was a voice. It was a female voice reading a list of numbers and random words, interrupted every so often by a bell tone. Her voice spoke plainly and monotonously, but something in it sounded condescending, conspiratorial, and vaguely mocking, like she was smiling while she spoke but had no real emotion. The whole thing freaked me out. The next day, I heard the same thing at the same time. Noise, song, same voice reading off numbers and nonsense words. It repeated for a week. The jarring noise woke me up last night. It never happened at night, only 3:07 pm every day. The voice came right after the noise this time, no song. She sounded different. Distressed. I heard a shuffling of papers. \"Tw- two. Five. Sailboat. S- seven. Conifer. I- oh god. I hope they aren't listening.\" She took a breath. I pulled out my phone and started recording, incase I needed to reference the audio later. I did end up listening to it, several times in fact, but nothing is clearer for me. I referenced it to write this too, to make sure I got everything right that she said. \"Okay.\" Ding! \"Twenty left. Okay. Listen, if there's anyone listen to me, please-\" ding! \"Who am I kidding. No one will be listening to this. Ah- if there is anyone listening, I-\" ding! \"S***. Remember this. Uh, alpha. Twenty-two. Not that. Remember this: a bird in the basket is worth three hundred twelve in the oak. Show me.\" Ding! \"Please. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to work for these people, I don't- I don't want to be here. I- I know what's going on.\" Ding! \"Please. Please. Pl-\" The broadcast ended. From then on, the station was just white noise. At the time of the usual broadcast, the noise went off and the song played, but there was no voice of bel tones, just silence. I turned the dial once and turned it back, and the station was replaced by loud crackling. I haven't heard anything else from it since. Please guys, I don't know what's going on. I want to help that girl with whatever is going on, but I don't even know if it's real, or if it is, where to start. Edit: Update- The girl I heard made a post here: And I updated with what ended up happening here: (Lots of answers)",
