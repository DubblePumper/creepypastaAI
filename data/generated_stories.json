      "content": "I was a police officer at the time. My family and I lived in a poor state, barely scraping by. Vacations were a luxury we could never afford, and I always felt guilty that my kids never really got to enjoy their childhood like they should have. That changed on April 13th, 1997. I still remember the date—burned into my memory as the scariest day of my life. After a rare big paycheck and with my kids doing well in school, I decided to reward them. I bought them a Nintendo console I think it was a Super Nintendo, though I can’t quite remember. What I do remember is how their faces lit up. Pure joy. The next morning, they were already up, huddled around the TV, playing non-stop. They’d never owned a console before, so I couldn’t blame them. But just five days later, it broke. Maybe it overheated, or maybe it was just too old. I took it to a local repair shop. The guy there told me he couldn’t fix it but offered me a used one instead. I hesitated, but took it. I figured the kids would be happy either way. That evening, they plugged it in but something was off. The game loaded by itself, and it wasn’t anything I recognized. I saw Mario, but something was... wrong. I brushed it off. How could I have known what was coming? That night, I woke up around 3 a.m. for my shift. As I walked past the living room, I noticed the TV was on again even though I had turned it off before bed. I reached to switch it off, but as soon as I did... something appeared at the window. A shadowy figure. It wasn’t human. It wasn’t even animal. It looked... like a character from a game. Its shape was distorted, glitchy, like something trying to exist in our world but failing. I was frozen in fear. I don’t know why, but I turned the console back on. And it vanished. I called in sick the next day. I needed time to process what I had seen. Days passed quietly until another night at exactly 12 a.m., I heard the front door creak open. I thought it was my son sneaking out of bed. I was dead wrong. The same shadow figure walked in but now, with the light on, I saw its face. It had my son’s face... but warped, lifeless, and stretched across a deformed, hunched body. I nearly fainted. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t scream. And then, just like that, it left. I would’ve thought it was a nightmare, but when I inspected the door... it had claw marks. Still shaken, I turned on the Nintendo one last time. The screen flickered. A single image loaded. It was a picture of me. Sleeping. That was it. I called the station. Some officers dismissed me. But my chief... he believed me. Turns out, a family in California had been found murdered just a few weeks earlier. The only clue left behind was a Nintendo controller shoved into the father's skull. I still wonder what would have happened if I had ignored the signs. If I hadn’t gone to the station that day. Would my family still be here? Please, if anyone has information about a used Nintendo console like this—don’t plug it in. Burn it.",

We were in the middle of a match, getting some sick kills, when suddenly this low, creepy voice comes out of nowhere and says \"Fetch me their souls.\" I'm not even kidding, it sent chills down my spine. Then, after I got another kill, my screen froze on the damage screen and when it came back, I was standing outside the map in some dark, deserted landscape. I tried to call out to my squad, but they were muted. Next thing I know, I'm sliding down a hill, and it's like I'm in a completely different game. We all died at the same time, and the game just... it felt off. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I'm seriously freaked out, guys. Anyone know what could've caused this? Edit: I'm still getting some weird glitches and errors after this happened. Anyone know how to troubleshoot this?",

      "title": "Whenever Jeremy eats the steak, he feels like he is sleeping with the chef",
      "content": "I took Jeremy to a steak house restaurant that literally have their own cows, and that's how fresh they are. When Jeremy first ordered his steak and he ate into it, he looked at me with great concern. He said to me that he feels like he had sex with the chef, and I smiled because I assumed that the comment meant that he enjoyed the steak. Jeremy wasn't smiling though and he then had another deepening concerning look. I then asked him if he was OK and he replied \"I feel like I am having sex with the chef\" Then Jeremy nodded his head and he told me \"look the steak is amazing but very time I eat it, it feels like I am having se with the chef and I don't know why?\" And I gave a weird look back at Jeremy. I had no idea what he was on about but he just kind of put me off about my food. I said to Jeremy to stop being weird and to just eat his steak. The restaurant is a lovely place with their own farm and it's amazing to walk through it. Then after we paid the bill both Jeremy and I had agreed that the steak was the best ever one we have both had in our lives. Walking through the farm lands that belonged to the restaurant and seeing all other the cows, it's a genius idea for a farm to start a restaurant. Then the second time me and Jeremy went to the steak restaurant, it was amazing but Jeremy had this concerned look again. He told me that he felt like he was getting beaten up by the chef that cooked his steak this time, he loved it though and I just kind of stare at him like he was crazy. He is my long time friend and I have never seen him acting this strange. Then the third time we both went to that steak restaurant, Jeremy loved the steak but he felt he was having sex with the chef this time. As we went out and walked through the scenic farm field, there was a painful groan coming from a cow and inside some shed. It was open and when me and Jeremy checked it out, the head chef was enacting beastiality upon that cow. Then in another shed we heard more cries from a cow and when we checked that shed out, the chef was beating the cow. So Jeremy was right all along and we will no longer be going to that restaurant ever again.",

      "content": "Tom Cruise is known for his big actions epics and wild out of this world death defying stunts. Right now though people are kind of use to seeing Tom Cruise defy all odds and pull off an impossible stunt. He has done it all and the audience is getting bored. We need to see something new with Tom Cruise and I had just the idea. For Tom cruises next big death defying stunt, Tom Cruise will actually have to fail and die. Imagine what people would think and the billions of dollars this will produce. I knew exactly how to pull this off. So I made another big epic action 9th surprise installment of mission impossible with Tom Cruise as the star and a big stunt he will have to do. I will tell cruise what he will do and show him all of the safety features, and I will even let him have a few practice runs. The stunt is basically hanging off a helicopter again but just higher up and cruise will have no problems with this. I mean everyone expected the mission impossible franchise to end after the 8th film, so when everyone gets surprised with a 9th film, people will be so surprised. I give a script to cruise and he thinks the film is going one way. Then I hold a secret meeting with the rest of the cast, crew and director. I tell them that I am going to make sure that Tom Cruise will fail in the stunt because of me secretly messing around with the helicopter. Then we will advertise the 9th instalment of mission impossible as 'watch Tom Cruise as Ethan hunt doing another daring stunt! And failing at it miserably and dying.' The audience will be even more stunned by this because they are use to seeing cruise being successful in doing stunts, so when they hear him being unsuccessful at doing a stunt and actually dying, they will want to see it for sure. It's also a definite billion dollars earner. The rest of the cast were behind me in doing this, because let's face it their careers needed a boost. So everything is set up and tom Cruise thinks the film is going one way, while the rest of the cast knows it will go another way. I mean everyone will want to see this and they are so bored of Tom Cruise pulling off another daring stunt, people need something different. So when the 9th instalment of mission impossible comes out, watch and be surprised as tom Cruise fails to do a stunt!",

I’m here looking for the kind of woman who doesn’t just wear danger — she is danger. You know the type: red lips, calm eyes, and a body count hidden behind charming smiles and perfect manners. A killer in heels. A manipulator who turns love into a weapon and desire into control. If that sounds like you, then I’m already interested. I’m not offering flowers. I offer a match and a bottle of gasoline. A chance to create something intense — twisted, maybe even destructive — but real. Something worth bleeding for. Worth fearing. Your exes? I assume they’re long gone. Figuratively… or otherwise. You’re not the type to leave survivors. And that’s what I find beautiful. You don’t just break hearts — you dissect them. I don’t want a partner. I want a rival. A mirror. Someone who understands that the line between love and death is thinner than most think — and knows how to dance right on it. If your kiss is poison and your heart’s a locked vault, then send me a message. Let’s see how far down the rabbit hole we can go.",

      "content": "Each step down the creaking, narrow staircase leads you deeper into the damp shadows, the walls pressing closer with each descent. The air is thick, smelling faintly of mildew and earth. Somewhere above, the mansion sits in silence, unaware, or perhaps indifferent, that you’re slipping into its hidden spaces. You hesitate on a step, listening to the quiet, but then you feel it: a faint, rhythmic thrum beneath your feet. It’s almost unnoticeable, this pulse, but it’s there, vibrating through the old wood, beating in sync with the rhythm of your heart. You press on, curiosity outweighing caution as the walls grow rougher, jagged stones now lining the narrow corridor. The pulse grows stronger, humming up through your soles, through your legs, tugging you forward as if it were alive. Ahead, the darkness seems to breathe, as if something is waiting just beyond reach. You touch the wall, grounding yourself, but even the stones beneath your fingertips vibrate, the pulsing beat now almost steady, alive, as if the house itself has a heartbeat buried deep within. You stop, hold your breath. For a moment, you wonder if it’s your own heart that’s echoing back at you, but no, this pulse is older, deeper. It’s something ancient, waiting, patient as stone. You take a step back, feel the pulse fade with each step upward, but you know it’s still there, buried in the dark, waiting for someone else to find it.",

      "content": "Note: This is my original work. Also this started out as an another oc world and somehow took a dark turn. Yes this is made by taking inspiration from dreamcore, weirdcore, backrooms and liminal spaces. This is all fictional. There is a world, The Axis Sanctum, which you may enter from 2:20am, it opens only for 4 minutes and 17 seconds a phenomen known as the Veil's Blink. You MUST enter during the time too early? Or too late? Is dangerous. There are some rules which you must keep in mind: 1. Never speak nor write down your true name in the Sanctum. The Sanctum feeds on names. Saying or writing your true name causes it to bleed from reality, drawing unseen eyes and endless whispers. If you must write it, burn the paper before entering—or risk vanishing into silence. 2. Do not follow the flicker of shifting shadows. Shadows here twist and move with a will of their own. They don’t guide you home—they lead you deeper into the maze, to places no one returns from. If a shadow flickers near, look away. Do not follow. 3. Refuse any direction, drink, food or help. Nothing inside the Sanctum is what it seems. Accepting help, directions, or sustenance binds you to this place. The smallest favor or bite can trap your soul in endless wandering or worse... 4. Never touch the glowing cracks in the walls—nor the drifting stars. These fractures are tears in reality, dangerous and unpredictable. Touching them can tear your mind or body apart—or trap you forever between worlds. Watch from a distance and never reach out. A few extra things ALWAYS leave BEFORE 4am, the Sanctum’s power grows, and escape becomes almost impossible. Time warps and creatures become merciless hunters. Find the Gate of Fractures to escape you must exit it BEFORE the Veil's Blink closes or find yourself trapped.. waiting until it opens again To bind yourself to reality, you may bring a watch or spare watches in hand...but be warned to not stare to check the time often. Time is a fickle thing inside the Sanctum, checking too often may spiral you to madness. Only check when nessacary. The hand of your watch will point to the Gate when 4am strikes closer... DON'T ignore them. I wish you safe travels...",

Cheguei na escola fui direto pra sala não vi meu amigo pensei será se ele nao vem hoje? Passou 5 minutos ele chegou Falei ei achei que você ia me deixar sozinho nessa aula chata,ele riu é disse eae como vai? Eu ri e disse mais ou menos quero te contar uma coisa no intervalo, a professora já tinha começado a aula então era difícil conversar ali Depois da aula peguei meu lanche e fui sentar com meu amigo no pátio, ele perguntou oque era que eu queria contar eu disse: provavelmente você não vai acreditar em mim mas tenho que falar disso com alguém Contei tudo para ele e ele comentou Acho que você está vendo muito filmes de terror, não foi um pesadelo não? Eu irritado disse: lógico que não sabia que ia pensar que sou louco, ele disse calma cara eu acredito em você mas realmente parece loucura,você acha que essa coisa ainda tá na sua casa? Eu dise eu espero que não. Depois da aula cheguei em casa faminto fui almoçar depois fui assistir um pouco de desenho tinha esquecido por um instante daquela coisa, mais tarde meus amigos me chamaram pra brincar, acabei indo Ficamos brincando por umas hora apenas Minha mãe me chamou pois tinha algumas atividades da escola pra fazer acabei voltando pra casa cedo e fui fazer as atividades o dia foi passando Deu 18 horas estava ficando tudo escuro Me deu um arrepio de lembrar que a noite estava tão perto, e o pior eu ia ter que dormir no meu quarto tentei afastar esses pensamentos, chegou a hora do almoço fiquei conversando com meus pais depois fomos ver um filme chegou a hora de dormi Eu fiquei com um aperto no coração não sei explicar mas quando minha mãe me colocou na cama é disse boa noite filho e fechou a porta eu imediatamente olhei para o guarda roupa, e não tinha nada fiquei aliviado mas Ao mesmo tempo fiquei será se ele foi embora ou está escondido em algum lugar? Eu estava sem sono mas a noite foi passando e eu acabei dormindo, dormi algumas horas e acordei de madrugada denovo, senti uma coisa gelada caindo no meu rosto por um segundo eu passei a mão no rosto ainda No estado meio que dormindo e acordado ao mesmo tempo, quando abri os olhos minha alma saiu do corpo por um tempo eu vi aquela coisa mas ele estava tão perto que aquilo era algo que saia dos olhos dele, o mais estranho era que ele não se movia não piscava ele era como um boneco imóvel eu estava tão apavorado que fiquei olhando por um tempo até cair na real,por mais que ele não se mexesse aquela presença me deixava fraco Meio tonto, parecia sugar minhas forças Crie coragem levantei e fui correndo pro quarto dos meus pais entrei lá assustei minha mãe que disse oque foi filho? Eu falei mãe tem algo no quarto Ela disse filho... Pensei que só eu visse aquilo. (eu não sei se continuo ou deixo o final aberto pra dar uma vibe de terror desconhecido)",

      "title": "How do I prove to the judge that the video showing me getting beat up, is not an AI video?",
      "content": "I got punched by a guy who lives on the same floor as me, it's on the 8th floor. There are no cameras on the floors or on the stair ways. So this guy has loud parties and is always causing trouble and no body on the block likes him. Anyway he punched me and I contacted the police and i even recorded it, he started telling police that it was all made by AI. Now let me recap and say that I wear body cameras where ever I go as I suffer from anxiety and body cameras make me feel safe. So when this guy punched me, I had it all recorded but the police weren't too sure whether it was real or not. Then when the police weren't going to take further action as they thought it was all AI, I took the guy to court. I was sure that the recording would be enough and I still had the bruise on my left eye and it still hurt. Even the judge was questioning the video and all I had for support was from my grown adult daughter. I always talk to her and she has been giving me words of comfort, she lives with her boyfriend in some fancy apartment. Well more fancier than mine. Then when I got the stupid idiot of a neighbour actually stabbing me on camera, and had the actual stab marks on my body and luckily it didn't go in too deep, the guy was still accusing me of creating an AI video. The courts, the lawyers and judges were still on the fence whether it was an AI video or not. Also my apt got robbed and my computer was taken and everything. The idiot of a neighbour kept accusing me of creating an AI video of him attacking me. It was going to be a long fight but I got to speak to my daughter. She was giving me encouraging words and she told me how great her life was going and that everything was OK. Then one day I saw her boyfriend flirting with other women outside in some clubs. I told my daughter but she said that it was fine and that they are in an open relationship. This confused me because my daughter had always been against that sort of thing, I let it go though. Then finally the courts decided that the video was real and the guy got charged and taken to prison. As happy as I am, I have a confession to make, and basically I did create an AI video of that guy hitting me. I took secret photos of him and used that for AI to replicate. I had to punch myself and even stab myself as evidence. I destroyed my laptop and reported it as stolen to the police. I just wanted that guy to be gone. Then I get a phone call from the police about my daughter, they tell me that she had been dead for months and that the putrid smell made her neighbours report something as off to them. Her boyfriend killed her 4 months ago and stuffed her body in the storage room, which was right next to the hallway and which is why the other residents in their block could smell it. I also found out that I had been conversing with an AI voice of my daughter which could think of what to say to me. The AI even made a deep fake video of my daughter when I spoke to her through video call. I guess karma goes round.",

      "content": "Let me explain. I’m a 25-year-old man who just recently moved out of his parents’ house. Not long ago, I got an apartment not too far from the city center, which worked out perfectly because of my job. The rent isn’t too expensive: just 6,000 Mexican pesos (around 311 dollars at the current exchange rate). Considering the location, I find it quite affordable. In fact, I’ve been thinking about getting a roommate to split costs and ease the burden a bit. Although the apartment is generally fine and everything seems to be going well, I’ve been experiencing some issues over the past few days. Food has started to go missing. At first, I thought maybe it was me—maybe I had forgotten I ate it. But no. The food that disappears is usually the stuff I leave on the table, but what’s even stranger is that sometimes I don’t leave anything out… and still, I find the pantry open. Food has even gone missing from the fridge. At first, I thought it might be rats. But… what kind of rat opens a pantry? Or a refrigerator? And more importantly, closes it again afterward? Maybe a really big, incredibly smart rat—though that sounds more like a movie scene than a real-life problem. What unsettles me even more is that sometimes I hear noises in the kitchen right when I’m about to fall asleep. I know I should get up and check, but honestly… I’m afraid of finding out what’s really going on. So I’m thinking of buying security cameras.",

      "title": "He Knocked Four Times,Then My Life Ended",
      "content": "I never believed in those old creepypasta stories. The masked killer, the spiraled eyes, the axe. Theo Hollow was just another campfire myth, something edgy kids posted on forums for karma. At least, that’s what I thought—until he showed up at my door. It was past midnight. I was alone at home, binge-watching garbage on TV, when I heard knocking. Not urgent or panicked—just slow. Four knocks. Pause. Four more. When I checked the peephole, no one was there. And yet… the knocking continued. The third time, I opened the door. He was standing right there—gray hoodie, black mask like melted tar, with white spirals where his eyes should’ve been. The air felt wrong, like it folded around him. In his hand was an axe with a curved wooden handle, stained dark at the edge. I froze. He tilted his head. The spirals on his face started to pulse—slow, hypnotic, almost breathing. I slammed the door and locked it. Pointless. Somehow, he was already inside. I turned around and there he was, halfway down my hallway. I don’t know how he moved so silently. One second nothing, the next—him. My chest seized. I barely made it upstairs. My heart was thundering in my ears, and the walls—God, the walls—they started to bleed. Thin lines of red trickling down the paint like veins bursting open. I barricaded myself in the bedroom with the dresser, tried to call 911, but the line was dead. No signal. No power. My phone drained to zero in seconds. That’s when I heard them. Voices. Coming from the vents, the cracks in the wall, the floorboards. Familiar voices. My mom, who passed five years ago. My sister, who died in a fire. All of them whispering: “Let him in.” When he broke through the door, it wasn’t loud or dramatic. Just wood cracking like old bones. He stepped inside, dragging the axe behind him, letting it carve a scar across my floor. I threw a lamp at him. It shattered. He didn’t even flinch. The swing came fast. The axe buried itself in my thigh and hit bone. I felt it shatter inside me. Pain ripped through me so violently I couldn’t even scream. I just collapsed, twitching, trying to crawl. And he stood over me. Watching. For a second, I swear I saw under the mask. Just a glimpse. A boy’s face, burnt and twisted, mouth sewn shut with wire. Black tears leaking from his eyes. Then—just the spirals again, spinning faster now, dragging me into that abyss behind them. I don’t know why he didn’t finish me. I woke up hours later, stuffed in the hall closet. My blood soaked half the carpet. My leg’s useless. Everything smells like rust and rot. On the wall, smeared in what looked like raw flesh, he’d written: “I SEE YOU NOW.” He’s still here. I know it. I can feel him watching me through the glass of the TV, the hallway mirror, the screen of this laptop. So if you’re reading this—break your mirrors. Smash your screens. Don’t look too long into anything that reflects. Because if you do… You’ll see those spirals. And by then, it’s already too late.",

Una familia lo habia adoptado. Cuando era pequeño se habia lastimado el ojo derecho y algunas veces no veia nada. -Emeterio era algo callado y tranquilo, estaba terminando la secundaria y no tenia tantos amigos; le gustaba las historias de terror o veia series policiales. -Un día, estaba mirando su computadora algunas cosas de terror. De repente, alguien tocaba su ventana; se acerco a la ventana, abrio un poco la cortina y vio a una persona alta sin rostro. El chico se quedo shockeado y cuando retrosedio un poco, se tropezo con su patineta y se golpeo su cabeza contra su escritorio. -Cuando se desperto, noto que estaba en el hospital. Sus padres estaban a su lado preocupados. \"¿Que paso?\" Dijo Emeterio. \"Te golpeaste cuando acomodabas tu habitacion.\" Dijo su madre. El chico sabia que no estaba acomodando su habitacion, habia visto otra cosa, pero no queria hablar tanto por el dolor de la cabeza. Pasaban las semanas, el chico tenia ataques de ira sin sentido y se cortaba los brazos. Sabia que alguien en su cabeza le decia esas cosas, pero cuando lo intentaban ayudar, él no se dejaba y los lastimaba. Algunas veces tomaba un remedio, pero no funcionaba. -Habia pasado 1 mes de lo sucedido y Emeterio no habia mejorado. Aunque sus padres lo habian mandado al Psicologo, el doctor no ayudaba y ni le prestaba atencion. El chico miraba por la ventana de su habitacion y siemore veía a la misma persona encapuchada, con unos anteojos, con un barvijo y con un hacha en la mano. Esa persona desconocida siempre lo miraba, como si estuviera esperando algo de él. Emeterio ya no soporto más, mato a su piscologo con un cuchillo y se escapo al bosque. La policia y la ambulancia lo buscaban, pero no aparecia en ningun lugar. El chico estaba en una casa abandonada y jugaba un poco con el pequeño mechero. De repente, alguien entro a la casa y era Ticci Toby. \"¿Que quieres de mí? Siempre me miras.\" Dijo Emeterio. \"No dire nada, solamente vendras con nosotros. Ademas, eres fuerte.\" Dijo Toby. Ambos se fueron en el oscuro bosque y nadie encontro a Emeterio. No se si se entiende esta historia, pero, intente resimir esta historia que la habia escuchado hace bastante tiempo. Algunas cosas no me las acuerdo tanto en esta historia. Espero que les guste. Si quieren saber algun detalle mas, pueden preguntarme.",

Where on earth does this whispering come from? I tracked the sound under my bed and looked in there but nothing. Nothing but darkness and a little bit of dust. I went back to bed and finally fell asleep. After what I assume to be a couple of hours I woke up from a terrifying nightmare. The whole world was burning and I could see my family burning alive. It was horrible and I was completely soaked in sweat. “Elijah” I heard again. There was this cat sized creature sitting on my chest. It was pale, had cat-like eyes that were glowing and ragged clothing. It had big ears and it was hairy. It just looked at me, I stared back but couldn’t say a thing. I was petrified. The sun was shining on my face and I jumped up from my bed. There was no sign of that creature so I thought it was just sleep paralysis. Then I heard it “Elijah” Glancing under my bed I noticed scratch marks. There were these small scratch marks under my bed directly where my head would be when I slept. “Elijah, we’ll meet again” It whispered in a raspy voice.",

      "content": "When I was 14, my brother, sister, and I had this ritual—night swims in our backyard pool. No lights, no goggles, no opening your eyes underwater. That was the rule. It made the game of hide-and-seek feel dangerous, exciting, like we were tempting the dark. But one night, I broke the rule. I waited until they weren’t looking, slipped on a pair of goggles, and dove into the deep end. Eight feet down, the water was black, heavy, and cold. As my vision adjusted, I saw her. My sister. Or what I thought was my sister. She was sitting cross-legged at the bottom of the pool, hair floating like seaweed around her face. Perfectly still. Peaceful. Too peaceful. I hovered above her, confused. She didn’t move. I surfaced, took a breath, then looked down again. Still there. Still sitting. Still staring—though I couldn’t see her eyes through the tangle of hair. “Damn,” I thought. “She’s really holding her breath.” I dove back down, reached out, and placed my hand on the top of her head—just a light tap. “You’re it,” I tried to say, though the words just bubbled out. She didn’t react. Not even a twitch. Her head tilted slightly, and her hair shifted just enough for me to realize something was off. Something was wrong. I stayed there with my hand on her for maybe seven seconds. Long enough to feel the cold. Then I heard my brother’s voice, far off—muffled, but clear enough to shake me. “What are you doing? You’ve been over there forever.” I turned, startled. He was standing in the shallow end—with my sister beside him. She laughed. “Are you gonna play or just keep going underwater?” I looked back down. The thing was still there. Cross-legged. Still. Waiting. I didn’t breathe. I didn’t think. I screamed. “Get out of the pool!” I scrambled to the edge, flipped on the pool lights. The water lit up in a pale blue glow… and the deep end was empty. Nothing was there. We never swam at night again. And to this day, none of us talk about the girl sitting at the bottom of the pool. Because we all saw her. And she wasn’t any of us.",

It Was A Very Fun And Goofy Show That Could Be Enjoyed By A Wide Range Of People, Including Me As A Child. But What I Saw Recently, Was Much Different… I Was On My PC Looking Through Random Obscure Streaming Sites When I Came Across This One Website. I Clicked On It, And I Was Greeted By A Black Screen With A Download Link For A Zip Folder, Which Apparently Contained Every Episode Of Ed Edd N Eddy. I Clicked On It And The File Began Downloading. Once It Had Finished, I Extracted The Folder And All That Was Inside The Folder Was One. AVI File Called “EENE. Avi”. I Thought That I Had Been Scammed Out Of My Time But I Clicked On The File Anyways Out Of Curiosity. What Was On The File Began To Play, And What I Saw, Was Sickening. The Energetic Theme Song Began To Play, It Was Almost Identical The The Regular Show. The Only Difference Being That It Would Freeze And Glitch Every Couple Of Seconds, Then The Audio Would Speed Up To Catch Up With The Animation. There Was No Title Card, No Credits, It Just Skipped Straight To The Episode. It Began With Edd Sleeping In His Bed. One Thing I Noticed Was That The Video Quality Was Poor, Like It Had Been Recorded On An Old Camera. Double D Is Then Awoken By The Sound Of Knocking On His Door. He Then Goes Downstairs And Opens His Door, Where He Is Greeted By Eddy. Eddy Tells Him That He Has Come Up With His Best Scam Yet And Comedically Drags Double D Out Of His House. It Then Cuts To Eddy, Ed And Double D Looking At Something Offscreen. It Is Then Revealed What They’re Looking At, A Barrel Of Water. The Water Bubbled, Indicating That It Was Boiling. Eddy Then Walks Away And Returns After A Couple Of Seconds With Kevin. Kevin Then Asks What They Are Up To. Eddy The Leads Him Closer To The Barrel, Eventually To The Point That Both Of Them Are Right In Front Of The Barrel And Are Looking Into It. I Thought That The Episode Was Going To Take A Lighthearted, Comedic Approach Like Eddy Throwing Kevin’s Cap Into The Bucket. I Was Wrong, Very Wrong… Eddy, Without Hesitation, Trips Up Kevin, Causing Him To Fall Headfirst Into The Boiling Water. Eddy Then Shuts The Lid Of The Barrel. I Could Hear Kevin’s Muffled Thrashing And Screaming From Inside The Bucket. It Sounded Like His Voice Actor Was In Genuine Distress. Over A Solid Minute, The Sounds Gradually Grew Quieter And Eventually Stopped. Eddy Then Opened The Lid And We Got To See The Contents Inside. What I Saw, Left Me Mortified… Kevin’s Scalded, Unrecognisable Body, Was Floating On The Water, Motionless. He Had A Large Amount Of Scald Marks On His Body. What Made It So Much Worse, Was That The Body Looked Realistic, Like They Had Actually Edited Someone’s Scalded Corpse Into The Episode. Eddy Then Grabbed Some Gloves. Once He Had Put Them On, He Grabbed Kevin’s Body. Ed And Double D Were Stood There Frozen, With Traumatised Looks On Their Faces. Eddy Then Told Them That If They Told Anyone, They Would Be Next. It Then Cut To A Scene Of Eddy In His Kitchen With Kevin’s Corpse On A Chopping Board. Eddy Then Grabs A Butcher Knife And Starts Cutting Kevin’s Body Into Slices Until He Was Even More Unrecognisable. It Then Cut To Another Scene. It Showed A Stand Outside Of Eddy’s House With A Long Line Of Customers Made Up Of Sarah, Johnny, Jimmy, Nazz And Rolf. There Was A Sign In Front Of The Stand Which Read “Roast Beef, 25c”. Eddy Was At The Counter Of The Stand, Giving Out The Slices Of Kevin’s Body To The Kids In Exchange For Their Quarters. Everyone Seemed To Enjoy Their Food. Strangely, Nobody Questioned Kevin’s Disappearance. The Scene Then Faded To Black, But Then I Saw An Image Flash For A Split Second. I Then Rewound The Video. The Image Was A Single Frame Of The Cul-De-Sac On Fire. The Episode Then Ended With The Normal Credits. I Sat There In Silence, At A Loss For Words. I Then Shut Off The Computer And Watched Some Tv Downstairs To Calm Myself Down. I Had Vivid Nightmares For Weeks About Being Trapped In That Barrel. Every Time I Watch That Show, The Memories Flood Back.",

      "content": "You don't know me. But I know you. Not in the superficial way people connect today, exchanging likes and empty comments on carefully staged photos. I really know you. I know the exact way the morning light hits your face when you finally open your eyes, still floating between dream and wakefulness. I know the small hesitation before choosing the outfit for the day, the almost imperceptible sigh when you realize you're late once again. It's these little details that paint the real picture, the unfiltered version you think you keep just for yourself. It started unpretentiously, I assure you. A momentary curiosity, perhaps. Your profile appeared as a suggestion, one of those happy coincidences of the algorithm. A photo of you smiling, holding a disposable coffee cup, the caption talking about how small joys can redeem a Monday. Trivial, at first glance. But there was something there, a spark of authenticity rare amidst so much performance. I clicked. And then, like someone pulling at a loose thread in a delicate fabric, I began to unravel the complex tapestry of his life. Your apartment. I know exactly where it is. It wasn't much of a challenge to figure it out; you mark the location of that charming cafe on the corner almost daily. Interestingly, it's just a few blocks from mine. A pleasant walk, especially at dusk, when the city lights begin to twinkle and the windows turn into small screens, displaying intimate fragments of other people's lives. Your window, I must admit, has become my favorite. The curtain is never completely closed. A mere oversight? Perhaps. Or, who knows, an unconscious part of you longs to be seen, truly understood. I watch you arrive from work, visibly exhausted. Shoulders hunched under the invisible weight of the day, the bag seeming to contain more than objects. You throw the keys on the table in the hall – invariably in the same place. He turns on the television, but his gaze is lost in the void, his mind is distant. Take your cell phone. Swipe your finger through the infinite feed, in an incessant search for a connection that always seems to slip through your fingers. I notice the subtle frustration that shadows his face. They don't understand her. None of them. Neither the noisy friends in the photos, nor the co-worker who clearly simulates a non-existent interest. They only see the surface, the carefully constructed persona you project to the world. But I see beyond. I see the collection of books on the shelf, the genres you're truly passionate about, not the ones you mention in conversation to sound intellectual. I see the pen notes in the margins, the passages that touched her deeply. I see the half-forgotten plant in the corner of the room, which you insist on trying to revive, even when you forget to water it. I listen to the playlist you listen to when you think no one is around, that bittersweet mix of nostalgia and silent hope. Occasionally, I allow myself small interventions. Subtle, almost imperceptible gestures. That rare book you casually mentioned online, out of print on every major chain? It appeared as if by magic on the shelf of a small independent bookstore near his office. A happy coincidence, you might have thought. That somewhat inconvenient “friend” who always seemed to monopolize your time and energy? He seems to have withdrawn lately, suddenly absorbed by his own dramas. Lucky you, right? Don't get me wrong. My intentions are the best. I do this because I understand her on a level that no one else can. Because I see the brilliant potential that lies beneath the layers of insecurity and other people's expectations. My only desire is to protect this essence. I want to cultivate an environment where you can flourish, free from the distractions and negative influences that insist on surrounding you. Last night, you left the window open a little wider than usual. The night breeze swayed the curtain gently, like an invitation. I could see her falling asleep on the couch, a book forgotten on her lap. For a fleeting moment, I felt an almost irresistible urge to… intervene more directly. Adjust the blanket over your shoulders, turn off the light in the room that was left on, ensure your comfort and safety. I held back, of course. Patience is a virtue. The right time has not yet arrived. But he approaches, inexorably. Our connection deepens every day. You are not yet aware of it, but every detail of your existence, every breath, every thought that you consider to be exclusively yours… I am there. Observing. Understanding. Waiting. I see the world through your eyes. And very soon, you will see the world through mine. You just haven't realized it yet.",

      "content": "I used to live in this old apartment once. The place I lived in when I was younger was actually a large house that had probably been split into two separate units. I had a kitchen, a living room, a bedroom, and a bathroom. There was also a staircase leading down to a small entryway and a door. I assumed the other side of the house was laid out the same, but I never knew who lived there. I stayed in that apartment for a few months. It was cheap and close to my work, and aside from that, nothing about it was particularly special. During the first month, nothing strange happened. I was usually working a lot, and when I was home, everything seemed perfectly normal. But then I started noticing something odd — I would wake up in the middle of the night for no clear reason. At first, I only remembered waking up and then falling right back asleep. One time, I thought I had heard a noise, but once I was awake, I heard nothing else. I sat up in bed and listened carefully, but everything was silent. Eventually, I just fell back asleep. It struck me as strange because I usually slept very deeply and never woke up during the night. These were the kinds of moments I often barely remembered the next day. But after about a week, the third time I woke up in the middle of the night, I was certain I had heard something. It was genuinely odd. I sat up again and listened closely, but there was no more sound. I couldn’t tell if I’d heard it in a dream or while I was awake. Everything felt strange, but nothing else happened and I eventually drifted off again. I couldn’t figure out why I kept waking up or what was causing it. Then, one night, it happened again. This time, I remember I didn’t hear anything at first — I just suddenly woke up, fully alert. I didn’t sit up; I just turned over to face the other side of the room. My room was dark, and as I looked in that direction, I heard a faint creaking sound. It was like the door to my bedroom was slowly opening. I looked that way — and saw it really was opening. Then, suddenly, a man stepped inside. I couldn’t make out many details — it was too dark. He took one step into the room and stopped. I was frozen with fear. It was so dark, I didn’t even know if he could tell I was awake. Then, he pulled out what looked like a camera — and took a photo of me. After that, he stepped back behind the door and into the hallway. I couldn’t believe what had just happened. Then I heard faint creaking from the hallway, like a door being opened and closed. Very soft, but noticeable. And then — silence again. I sat there in bed for at least 10 or 20 minutes, not hearing a thing. I didn’t know if I was being robbed or if someone was still inside. But since it stayed quiet for so long, I finally got up. I walked around my bedroom — still no sound. Then, slowly, I checked the rest of the apartment. It wasn’t a large place, so it didn’t take long to realize the man was gone. But when I reached the end of the hallway upstairs, past my bedroom and across from a closet, I noticed something. There was a door that connected to the neighbor’s unit. I had been told that this door wasn’t used and was always locked. In fact, there was a small table and a lamp placed in front of it. The door had even been painted the same color as the wall, so it was hard to notice. But I realized the man must have come through there. It must not have been locked from the other side. After that night, I couldn’t sleep at all. I stayed up until morning. As soon as it was light, I contacted the building management. I told them everything that had happened and immediately began looking for another apartment. I stayed with a friend for a few nights. Long story short, it turned out there was a man living in the neighboring unit — and he was eventually caught. Thankfully, he never got into my apartment again. The nights I kept waking up were probably the times he was sneaking back into his place — maybe when he was closing that hidden door. Seeing him in my room was the most terrifying moment of my life. I will never forget it. Check out more True Chilling Apartment Horror Stories",

      "content": "\"I am The Witness, I have watched men bargain with shadows, wrestle with storms, and try to shout louder than silence itself. But none run more blindly than those who run from her. This is the tale of Tony Keller, a man who thought he could escape the inevitable.\" The first thing Tony remembered was waking up on cold pavement. Streetlights flickered above like stuttering stars. Rain patted gently against the earth. His car was nowhere in sight. No people. No sound. Only the long, empty stretch of Ashvale Avenue, lined with skeletal trees. “Hello?” he called out, throat dry. A voice answered—not loud. “Your time has come, Tony Keller.” Tony spun, heart punching his ribs. She stood at the end of the street. Her shape was that of a person carved from living shadow, her features lost in the black, save for two glowing white eyes that did not blink. No footsteps. No movement. Just her, watching. Tony stumbled back. “What the hell are you?” “I am Death,” she replied. He laughed. Short, nervous. “You’re here to kill me, huh?” Tony turned and ran. He didn’t look back. He couldn’t. “I’m not ready!” Tony screamed. “You already were,” her voice replied, from everywhere and nowhere. “It was peaceful, Tony. You didn’t even feel it.” “Feel what?” he gasped. But he kept running. Streetlamps flickered as he passed them. His legs never tired, his lungs never burned. He darted into a gas station—abandoned, flickering, the fluorescent light buzzing like a dying insect. Shelves of dust and rot. The register blinked 0:00. He looked into a mirror behind the counter. And saw nothing. No reflection. Only darkness. “No,” he whispered. “No, no, no...” The lights died. “You don’t have to be afraid,” she said from behind him. He turned slowly. Death stood in the doorway, filling the frame like a painting made of midnight. Her eyes, not cruel—just tired. Patient. “I don’t want to go,” Tony said, voice breaking. “I still have things to do. I have people.” “You had,” she corrected gently. “You don’t belong there anymore.” “You can’t make me!” he shouted, backing away. “You don’t get to decide!” “I don’t,” she said. “I only come when it’s time.” “Wake up!” he screamed. “Wake up, wake up!” “You’re not asleep,” Death whispered. “You’re just lost.” He found himself back in his house. Morning sun poured through the windows. He blinked. Coffee bubbled in the pot. A breeze stirred the curtains. He exhaled. “I made it,” he whispered. “I made it back.” The door opened. His wife walked in. Carrying a black urn. She didn’t see him. She placed the urn on the mantle, next to a photo of Tony. She lit a candle. Said nothing. Tony stood, frozen. The wind stirred again. Death stood behind him. “It was quick,” she said softly. “No pain. A truck. Rain-slicked road. You swerved to avoid a deer. You saved a life. But yours ended there.” He stared at the urn. At the photo. At the life he no longer had. “No,” he breathed. “No, no...” Death reached out a hand. Not forceful. Not cruel. Just waiting. “You ran long, Tony,” she said. “But you’ve reached the shore.” Tony trembled. Looked at his wife, her tear-lined cheeks. And then he took Death’s hand. They vanished together, like a sigh in the wind. \"Death is something that shouldn't be feared, what should be feared is how. Don't run from Death because you are already dead.\"",

      "content": "I met Daniel Whitaker in the fall of 2018. We were both part of the same volunteer fire department in rural Pennsylvania. He wasn’t the kind of man you forget—tall, quiet, the kind whose eyes always scanned the room like he was waiting for something terrible. He never smiled much, but he was kind, and there was never a question where his loyalty stood: with his wife, Claire, and their two kids, Ben and Ellie. What happened to them wasn’t in the papers. You wouldn’t find it on the local news or in online forums. But I was there when we responded to the 911 call that night. And I know what I saw. It started with a weird noise. Claire described it as a whisper through the walls. It happened at night. Just after they’d gone to bed, they’d hear someone—or something—speaking words too distorted to understand. At first, Daniel thought it was just the wind or maybe an animal in the walls. But then Ben started waking up screaming, saying a “man without a face” was standing at the foot of his bed. They installed cameras. Nothing ever showed up. Not even shadows. But the whispers didn’t stop. Daniel came to me about it once. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. Said he thought something had followed him home from one of our calls—a burned-out farmhouse a few towns over. Said when he walked through the basement, he felt like he’d passed through a veil of cold air, like something old and angry was watching him. “It doesn’t want them,” he told me. “It wants me.” That night, Claire called 911. I got there before the others. The house was silent—no lights, no movement, just the front door wide open, like something had walked in and didn’t care to close it. I stepped inside, called out to Daniel, Claire, the kids. No answer. Then I heard a sound coming from the basement. Not footsteps. Something else. Something wet. I found Daniel there, sitting in the dark at the bottom of the stairs, holding a knife. At first, I thought he’d hurt himself. But he was uninjured. His hands were shaking. There were markings on the wall—symbols scratched in with what looked like blood. I tried to get him to come up with me, to tell me where Claire and the kids were. “They’re safe,” he whispered. “I told it I’d go first.” He looked at me then, and his eyes were hollow. “It promised it wouldn’t touch them if I said yes. If I went willingly.” Before I could stop him, he plunged the knife into his chest. We found Claire and the kids upstairs. They were alive, shaken but unharmed. Claire kept asking where Daniel was. When I told her… something passed over her face. Not shock. Not sorrow. Relief. “He said it would only take the first one,” she whispered. They moved away soon after. No forwarding address. No phone calls. But sometimes, when I’m alone at night, I swear I hear it too. A whisper through the walls, promising safety in exchange for something I’ll never get back. And I think about Daniel—how brave he was, how selfless. And how maybe, just maybe… it lied.",

      "content": "It's so much fun swapping diseases and illnesses, and it doesn't sound fun but it really is. Before joining in this great past time event, I was healthy with no diseases or illnesses of any kind. I was visiting a relative at a hospital and when the visit was over, I was walking towards the door that leads you out of the ward, I then saw a room with a group of people who had all sorts of diseases and illnesses. I stayed on the ward just watching them laugh and smile, they were all so happy that it wasn't common to see someone so happy like that. I saw cancer patients swapping their ailments with heart attack patients. It was truly surreal and something I thought I would never think of or see. Now healthy people with no illnesses or diseases of any kinds were allowed to join in and I thought that was unfair. Now the reason the hospital allowed this was because if a cancer patient passed on his illness to a heart attack patients, and vice versa, the cancer would have to start again in a new body by becoming small and the heart attack would have to start again in another new body. Now I knew that I wasn't allowed to join in due to having no illnesses of any kinds, but watching these people swapping their illnesses looked really fun. I needed that kind of fun in my life and so I secretly joined in. I didn't know how it worked but we just had to touch each other and the illness will swap with another person. I got someone's kidney problems, then I got someone's bone cancer, then I got someone brain damage problems. It was really fun seeing how my body changed and adapted. Then one person realised he had no illnesses anymore, it was because of me. He uttered \"I have no illness that means someone here had joined in the game without an illness when they shouldn't have done so!\" And when he tried to run out of the room because now he was healthy, even though it was my health, the others stopped him. Someone else haf touched that guy and then that woman was now healthy. Now everyone was fighting for my health, and I now realised why healthy people with no illnesses weren't allowed to play this game. I then saw a guy trying to sneak out of the room but I caught up to him and touched him. Now I had my health back. Then I ran out of that room and when that guy touched me, nothing was swapping because only in that room could you swap illnesses.",

      "content": "Part 1: I used to follow her online. Not in a weird way—just like everyone else did. Her name was Sofia Mendez. She was beautiful, full of life, and always smiling. She had this ability to talk through the camera like she was looking right at you, like she knew you. She ran a beauty channel. Makeup tutorials, hair tips, product reviews—nothing dark, nothing unusual. And recently, she’d opened her dream salon—“Blossom.” It was bright, pastel pink, all mirrors and fairy lights. But something changed in her streams about a week before it happened. She seemed nervous. Distracted. At first, I thought maybe it was just stress. A new business, lots of pressure, right? But then she mentioned something… odd. She said someone had been sending her gifts. Not fan mail. Not PR packages. Just… expensive things. A bottle of perfume in a black velvet box. No note. No label. A pair of designer heels—her exact size. And then a message appeared in her inbox: “For the face that must never fade.” Creepy? Sure. But she laughed it off. She even opened the gifts live, trying to make it a bit. But something about the way she smiled… it wasn’t the same. It didn’t reach her eyes. A few days later, she said on stream that someone had come to the salon. A delivery guy. But she couldn’t see his face—he wore a cap low over his eyes. “He knew my name,” she said. “But I never told him.” That was the last time she ever looked relaxed. And the last time any of us saw her alive. To be continued (check bio for channel link 8D audio Horror Stories, latest video post )...",

So I lost my but I love losing my way because when I find my way back again, it's the most greatest feeling. This time though I felt lost forever and I couldn't accept that our world was the real one. I just couldn't understand how our world was the real one and just looking at our world, I became saddened that our world was the real one. I went up to someone and started go kick him with my right leg and I kicked him in the knee and he fell down to the ground. He was in pain and I was observing him being in pain and this was proof that our world was real. So I kept kicking and when I kept on stamping on his head, he was no more. Why did this world have to be the real on and why not something else. This world made of brick and mortar, smelly air and pointless tasks. Why is this world the real world? So then I saw someone hanging onto the bridge, they must have decided not to jump last minute but they lost balance. With my right arm I helped the guy up and everyone deserve an helping hand in this world. This world that's the real one and what a dull world it is, and it would make a terrible fake world. Like it has no imagination or uniqueness and I started to become angry again. When I was at dead end job again my mind kept denying that this cannot be real, and that there has to be something else. I'd rather be living in a fake world doing fun stuff than this drivel. Like in another fake world another fake version of me is doing amazingly well and having a good time. I became jealous at that idea and I started to trash my work place. Then with my right leg I knocked out little one Janice with a kick to her face. I became horrified at what I had done in front of everyone and I hated this world being real even more, because this was now real with real consequences. I'm on the run now.",

      "content": "Sabe como é a vida na cidade grande, né? Correria, conta pra pagar, e a gente se vira como pode. Consegui alugar um cantinho no centro, prédio antigo, daqueles com a pintura descascando e o elevador que pensa duas vezes antes de subir. Apartamento 71. O preço era o que dava, e pelo menos era perto do trabalho. Tinha um cheiro de mofo que não saía por nada, mas achei que era só falta de ventilação. O antigo morador deixou umas tralhas pra trás. A imobiliária falou que eu podia jogar fora. No meio das caixas, achei um rádio antigo, daqueles de madeira escura, com botões amarelados. Pesado pra caramba. Por curiosidade, liguei na tomada. Funcionou. Pegava umas AM chiando, música velha, programa de notícia que parecia de outra época. Deixei ele num canto da sala, mais como enfeite esquisito. Logo na primeira semana, a umidade começou a ficar estranha. Não era só o cheiro. Manchas escuras brotavam nas paredes do quarto, perto da janela, como se a parede estivesse chorando uma água suja. E um frio... um frio que não combinava com o calorão lá fora. Vinha do nada, arrepiava a espinha, e parecia se concentrar perto do rádio velho. Comecei a ouvir coisas no chiado do rádio, mesmo desligado da tomada. Não era música, era... um lamento? Um choro baixo, quase um murmúrio de alguém com muita, muita dor. E às vezes, uma palavra solta no meio da estática: \"...volta...\", \"...minha...\". Achei que estava ficando maluco, cansaço, estresse. Normal na selva de pedra. Mas a sensação de não estar sozinho piorou. Sabe quando você sente que tem alguém te olhando, mesmo de costas? Era isso, o tempo todo. E o apartamento ficava mais frio, a umidade mais agressiva. As manchas na parede pareciam crescer, formar contornos que lembravam... um rosto? Um rosto triste, desesperado. Conversei com o Seu Antenor, o porteiro antigo do prédio. Perguntei do morador do 71 antes de mim. Ele fez uma cara estranha. \"Ah, o Seu Ramiro... Coitado. Morreu aí dentro mesmo. Dizem que de tristeza.\" Contou que o Seu Ramiro tinha perdido a esposa, muitos anos atrás, num acidente besta. Nunca superou. Ficou recluso, obcecado pela memória dela. Falava sozinho, chamava por ela. Os vizinhos ouviam choro vindo do apartamento dia e noite. Depois disso, as coisas desandaram de vez. O rádio ligava sozinho no meio da noite, sempre na mesma estação fantasma, com aquele lamento chiado. A umidade tomou conta do quarto, o cheiro de mofo era sufocante, e o frio era de congelar os ossos. Comecei a ter pesadelos horríveis: eu estava preso no apartamento escuro, e uma figura sombria, feita de sombra e mofo, tentava me abraçar, sussurrando \"fica comigo\", \"não me deixa\". Acordava suando frio, com o coração na boca. A figura dos sonhos começou a aparecer de relance no apartamento. Um vulto no canto do olho, um reflexo rápido no espelho do banheiro manchado de umidade. E a sensação de controle... sutil, mas estava lá. Uma vontade de não sair de casa, uma tristeza profunda que não era minha, uma raiva quando eu pensava em jogar o rádio fora. Uma noite, cheguei do trabalho exausto. O apartamento estava gelado, as paredes do quarto quase pretas de umidade. O rádio estava ligado, o lamento mais alto que nunca. Fui até ele pra desligar, e quando toquei no botão, senti um choque, mas não elétrico. Foi um choque de... sentimento. Uma onda de dor, de saudade, de possessividade tão forte que me fez cambalear. E no chiado, claro como água: \"ELA É MINHA! FICA!\". Não era pra mim. Era o Seu Ramiro. A dor dele tinha ficado ali, impregnada nas paredes, na umidade, no rádio. E ele não queria ficar sozinho. Ele queria companhia na sua miséria eterna. Pânico total. Peguei o rádio pesado, arranquei da tomada e corri pra fora do apartamento, desci as escadas tropeçando. Joguei o trambolho na caçamba de lixo lá na rua com toda a força. O som dele quebrando foi um alívio. Voltei pro 71. O frio tinha diminuído um pouco. A sensação de presença também. Mas a umidade... as manchas na parede... continuam lá. Às vezes, tarde da noite, ainda ouço um chiado baixo vindo do corredor, ou sinto aquele arrepio gelado. Não sei se jogar o rádio fora adiantou. Acho que a tristeza do Seu Ramiro virou parte do prédio, parte da cidade. E fico pensando... pra onde vai uma dor tão grande quando não tem mais onde ficar?",

Not just gone, but like they were never there?” He taps the bar with one yellowed nail. “That’s how you know the Skinkeeper’s passed through.” He swirls the drink but doesn’t sip. “Before cities, before songs, there were Hollow seasons. The sky turned white for weeks. And in those weeks… people went missing. But no one noticed at first. Because the ones taken—they were remembered wrong. You’d see a smile in a photo that wasn’t theirs. A laugh that didn’t quite fit. Like someone had tried to be them… and got close enough.” He glances at the cellar door, then back at you. “The Skinkeeper doesn’t eat. Doesn’t speak. It catalogues. Wears your skin like a coat it’s trying to break in. And when it’s done with you? It folds your memory up, tucks it in some hole beneath the world, and moves on.” “A boy once saw it. Said it had no face. Just threads and creases, like something that never fully formed. Its fingers—too gentle. Like it didn’t want to hurt you. Just… preserve you.” He finally drinks. Then says, quieter: “I used to have a brother. Swore he was real. Swore we carved our names into the tree out back. But when I checked… only my name was there. And I’m not sure if I ever carved it.” The lantern flickers. “And if I didn’t… maybe he’s the one who remembers me.”",

      "content": "06 March, 1761 My travels are at lasT at an end. Back in Virginia after two months away in Jamaica finalizing trade agreements with a cane supplier. I have acquired a various number of personal effects from my late cousin, Will Harris, a first mate and navigator on a private cargo vessel contracted and under the East India Company. Him and tHe rest of crew were made part of a tragic demise when their vessel was seemingly set ablaze and sunk outside the eastern Caribee Islands. From what I and numerous others would suspect to have bEen carried out by some damned and hellish pirates. The wreckage was discovered some months ago, no bodies were among the wreckage. All that remains are the personal belongings of some of the crew, like the ones I have brought back with me. A nuMber of small trinkets, a pair of eyeglasses, a captain’s whistle, a decent number of papers that show signs of water damage, and part of a mAp of the West Indies. I met the men at the East India Company port yard who gathered these belongings and I asked to keep them. They had gone unclaimed for some time and I was told that I was the only relative of any of the creW that could be reached. The strangest thing that I retrieved from the lot was an envelope addressed to me. It contains 2 books, one was a smaller pocketable book, the other was a bit larger. There seemed to be some confusion as to who at the port prepared the envelope. With one of the books being my cousin’s journal, I took possession of the other concluding it was a second book of Will’s. I have finally taken a look at the larger book and now see that it is something I have no business in keeping. It is the ship’s captain’s log. I have found the first log before the voyage in which the crew had met their unfortunate end. I sit here pondering whether I want to delve into these items. I may be stirring up some sort of misfortune upon myself by stirring up the personal writings of the dead. I never been one to believe in things of those sorts. Jonthan E. Harris ———————————————————————— Captain's Log: Cpt. Hendrik de Ruijter. 10, May 1760, Weather: Temperature, 82’F Wind, 9 knots West Light cloud coverage ReceivIng a few new crewmen today at port in Montego Bay. Two men I have already met, both strapping decent men. A couple of the men were delayed by the storm of last week. Same storm that damaged our rigging and main mast coming into port. I’ve left it to newly promoted First Mate, Will Harris, to see that the repairS are made to the damage that The Sea Wren has sustained as well as refitting two new cannons to her starboard side. Nearly 3 years now with my own ship and crew sailing the tropical West Indies hauling precious goods to and from the more remote ports and islands to be delivered to British, French, and SpanisH companies. The Sea Wren, being a Schooner, is a perfect vessel for these types of jobs. Its smaller size allows it to be fast and nimble, but still has a large enough bay to transport decently large amoUnts of cargo. Bulky East Indiamen and frigates are too large to navigate the waters between these smaller islands and ports, and I seem to have made a reputation of traveling waters most would consider innavigabible. We are scheduled to pick up and haul a shipmeNt of a large sum of indigo, ginger, and molasses from an island to the north of Grenada. Another discreet run for the East India Company near French controlled waters. Nevertheless thouGh, my vessel is one for hire and is at this time under employment of the East India Company, as it was under employment transpoRting supplies for the Spanish Navy all but a year ago. I am in good standings with most of the larger companies operating in the West Indies due to my taking of nearly impossible jobs other crews turn away. The Sea Wren travels freely wherever she may. We depart as soon as the rest of the new men arrive and repairs are finished. Expecting to make sail in within 48 hours towards the Lesser Antilles. PraYers that the winds favor us.",

Everything looked exactly the same - bed, desk, clothes on the floor - but something had been shifted. Like someone had copied it from memory and didn’t care about getting it perfect. The air felt like it was listening. That was the first thing. Like when a speaker’s plugged in and you can hear the faint hum even when it’s silent. The second thing was the mirror. It didn’t show me. It showed my room, yes - down to the wrinkled sheets and my chipped mug on the desk - but I wasn’t in it. I stood there for a full minute, not blinking. And then the reflection moved. Not me. The other me. She stepped forward. Same hair. Same shirt. Same scars. But she wasn’t copying me - she was acting on her own. She looked straight at me, then past me. And smiled. Not a creepy smile. Not sinister. Just… calm. Like she knew something I didn’t. Like she remembered something I forgot. Then it blinked. Not her - the whole reflection. A frame skip. For one second, the room was empty. For the next, she was gone, and I was staring at myself again. Everything looked normal again. But it wasn’t. I felt different, like something had been updated. I haven’t touched the mirror since. Sometimes it catches me at the wrong angle. Sometimes, it doesn’t catch me at all. I started writing it down. Just in case this version of me forgets.",

      "title": "The great book of concepts",
      "content": "The book of concepts is about a list of ideas and concepts. Beware to those who dare to read the book of concepts, too many concepts upon the mind can cause insanity and delusions. Concept 1: An astronaut was floating in space and his oxygen tank was running out of oxygen. He had accidentally wandered and floated away from his rocket. Then as his oxygen tank ran out of oxygen, he was still surprised that he could still breathe. Then he took his helmet off and he couldn't believe that he could breath in space. He was astounded by this but he knew something was wrong... Concept 2: a battle is ongoing in a town to become the most unknown person. 5 people are trying their best to be so unknown that they will kill anyone who looks at them. Then when there was only 1 guy left as the most unknown guy in the world, he knew that he had to kill himself as he knows himself. Concept 3. A famous singer on a singing contest show, hears the most beautiful voice he had ever heard and it was coming from a hotel. He tracks the room and when he goes in, no one was present. This was strange as he could hear the singing through the door. Then he realised that the singing is coming from something not human. Concept 4. A man tries to hang himself from his ceiling but something held onto the ropes, which stopped him from going down to far and cracking his neck. Then he sees a veiny grey coloured throat, and he realises that he accidentally hung the rope around a statue like creature. Concept 5. A family were terrified when someone started to break into their house through their front door, and it was just an Amazon delivery driver delivering parcels. Then the family started to notice other delivery people that were breaking into their house just to deliver a parcel. Concept 6. A man finds that his car has completely run out of petrol, but his car is still running. Then after of 2 hours of driving with an empty tank, he has no idea how his car is running. Then when he tried to change direction, the car doesn't work anymore. Then when he drives in the direction that he has been driving for the past 4 hours, his car suddenly works. Something wants him in that direction. Concept 6. Everytime when Roger opens the front door to go outside, there is always someone different outside his front door. Then when he closes the door and opens the door a minute later, there is a completely different person waiting outside. Roger doesn't want this at all. Concept 7. Mikey hates people that can shape shift and when he killed someone that can shape shift, mikey realised that this person regularly lost weight and put on weight, and allowed his hair to grow long only to cut it. So it looked like he was a shape shifter. Concept 8. To change one's name you can't just change a name, but Helen had to destroy how she lived her life and her whole past as Helen. Then when she destroyed her body she then found herself coming out of the womb as Rosie, but still looking exactly the same. Concept 9. After having a severe panic attack in my room when I found out that my mother had been killed by a bear, my room mate quietly called the police instead of consoling me. Then I found myself sitting at the same sofa as my room mate who just called the police. The room mate is acting all weird now and doing odd things like tip toeing around me and dancing silently. Concept 10. Gregory was so fat that he couldn't even fly as he was so heavy. One day as Gregory wanted to prove everyone wrong and he flew so high into the air, but it took all of his strength and he couldn't hold his weight in the air, and he fell down to the ground and he splattered himself all over the place. Concept 11. As jade and her family are moving in, they have to watch the other family being forcibly moved out as they couldn't pay rent. As jade and her family move in, they have to hear the pleas and cries of the other family whose stuff was being thrown out by the land lords men. Then as the other family were being kicked out at the same time as jade's family were moving in, jade's family was now a target. Concept 12. The multiverse is actually an octopus keeping all universes aligned and in peace. So as to celebrate the multiverse being held together by the great octopus, a group of people allowed themselves to drown in waters full of octopuses as a worthy sacrifice for the great octopus of the multiverse. Then through shere luck the great octopus of the universe was in the waters and through its great tentacles, the people who allowed themselves to be sacrificed, travelled to other alternate universes. That it will be it for the great book of concepts. We will carry on another time.",

      "content": "It was this story I heard on youtube a while back, it follows this young kid who got given a videocamera/ cam corder by a \"distant uncle\" for his birthday I believe, and his parents didn't want to talk about him. it later turns out that the uncle was the man who was originally supposed to adopt the narrator before his parents changed their minds. the stalker would watch the narrator and his friends (I believe two other boys) in the wood and the boys would try to mimic those cryptid hunting videos on youtube, catching the stalker in certain frames believing him to be a cryptid. and one day they devise a plan to catch the cryptid where the boys go into the woods with knives or something. it ends up going wrong and the boys get split up, only two of the boys came out of the woods and since they got split up they assumed the 3rd boy just went home but he never did. the other boy was accused of killing or attacking the missing boy but it later turned out that the stalker snatched the missing boy because he mistook the boy for the narrator. years later the narrator set out to figure out what happened to his friend and the stalker was found in a secluded shed dead holding the missing boy in his arms and they were all skeletal and the shed was covering in drawings I believe. I saw someone else post about this story on here about a month back also trying to find the name so if you know anything please let me know! (sorry for the wordiness)",

      "content": "I went to a restaurant where the waiters are paid to be rude to the customers. It's of the aesthetic of the restaurant, and the customers get a good laugh at the waiters being rude to them. This trend of rude waiters towards customers has been growing lately and there have been so many videos of these kinds of waiters being rude to the customer for laughs. I wanted to experience this myself and I found a restaurant where the waiters get paid to serve and be rude to the customers. I went alone and I couldn't wait to experience this. When I went in a waiter was straight away rude to me and rudely sat me down at a table, the waiter then told me that I had ruined his life for coming into the establishment. I laughed and I could hear other customers laughing as well. Then my rude waiter then said that I have till the dead guy decomposes fully and then I will have to leave. I was taken aback by this and was completely shocked to learn that this rude waiter wasn't joking. There were many dead people hung on the restaurant, and all customers had till their dead person decomposes and then they would have to leave. Then I saw a waiter punch and kick customers and the customers were all laughing. Then I saw another waiter stab another customers and everyone just laughed, because it was all part of the restaurant vibe. Something was off and I didn't want to really stay here anymore. Then my rude waiter threw water at me and he then shouted out loud \"you ruined my life\" and then I saw a waiter getting another customer in a choke hold. The waiter had literally killed the customer and everyone started laughing. Then as I tried to eat my meal quickly and pay the bill and leave, my rude waiter stopped me and shouted at me by saying \"has the dead guy for this table decomposed yet!\" And the dead for my table hadn’t decomposed. \"No it hasn't fully decomposed yet\" I calmly reply back to my rude waiter \"So then you can't go home until it has fully decomposed!\" My rude waiter had shouted at me So I was stuck here and the customer that was killed was dragged away somewhere. I know that these waiters are being paid to serve and be rude at the same time, but this is too much. I am going to try and make a run for it, I mean I am even ready to fight my rude waiter.",

      "content": "In the rugged, desolate mountains of Afghanistan, whispers told of a creature so terrifying it barely had a name. They called it Azraak, a sound that could curdle blood and freeze even the bravest warrior in their tracks. This wasn't just any beast; Azraak was a nightmare spun from ancient legends, born from the very guts of the earth and cursed with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Imagine a hulking mass of thick, black fur, with eyes that glowed like embers in the dead of night. Its claws and teeth, sharp enough to rip through steel, made it a force no one wanted to face. The villagers living in the mountains' shadow knew better than to go anywhere near Azraak's lair. But one night, a group of travelers, foolish enough to ignore every warning, decided to take a shortcut through that treacherous, rocky terrain. As they stumbled through the rugged landscape, a chilling sense of dread settled over them. The air grew heavy, thick with an unnatural silence. Then, a low growl rumbled through the mountains, sending a jolt of ice down their spines. Azraak had caught their scent. With an earth-shattering roar, Azraak burst from the shadows, its massive form eclipsing the moonlight. The travelers froze, paralyzed by fear as the monster advanced, its fiery eyes locked on them with a hunger that promised their end. One by one, the unlucky travelers fell to Azraak's merciless claws. Their screams tore through the night, echoing as their blood stained the rocks. The few who survived fled in a blind panic, their hearts hammering with the terrifying certainty that pure evil was hunting them. As dawn crept over the mountains, the villagers found the mangled remains of the travelers. It was a gruesome reminder of the deadly price of challenging fate in Azraak's domain. And so, the chilling legend of the beast lived on, a terrifying cautionary tale whispered for generations, warning anyone who dared to tread the haunted paths of the Afghan mountains.",

      "content": "It’s worse now. The walls speak more often. Not with words anymore, but with… feelings. Regret. Hunger. Rage. The little one barely speaks at all. She just draws. Circles within circles. Black crayon. Over and over, until the paper tears and her hands are smudged with wax like bruises. I barked when she started. I tried to stop her. But she looked at me with those wrong eyes. And said, “You’re not in charge here.” The family thinks she’s depressed. I know better. She’s becoming hollow. Each night I sleep less. I stand guard longer. I barely eat. The food tastes like dust now. Sometimes I forget how to be a dog. The shadows in the hall are never quite still. They curl and twitch when they think I’m not looking. One whispered my name last night, but it wasn’t a whisper—it was a snarl in disguise. And the doll? It’s back. It appeared on the couch, arms open like it had been waiting for a hug. No one put it there. Dad burned it this time. In the fire pit. We watched it melt, its plastic eye bursting like a blister. But the next morning, it sat in the little one’s chair. Untouched. Smiling. They took her to a doctor. The kind who smells like paper and antiseptic and tension. The little one didn’t talk to him. But she listened. And when he leaned close, she whispered something in his ear. His face turned white. He left early. Didn’t charge. He never came back. That night, I heard scratching under the floorboards. Claws. Nails. Not mine. I dug at the floor until my paws bled. They stopped me. Called me sick. Crazy. I’m not crazy. There’s something beneath us now. Something trying to come up. Sometimes I wonder if it’s already inside the house. Wearing skins made of whispers. Pretending to be memories. Two nights ago, I saw the little one standing in the hallway at 3 a.m. Still. Silent. Staring at the attic door. I stood beside her. Pressed my nose to her hand. It was cold. She didn’t blink. Then she said, “He told me your time is almost up.” And went back to bed. The attic door opened again last night. It didn’t creak. It sighed. Like something that had been waiting a very long time was finally stretching its limbs. I climbed the stairs. It smelled of dirt and blood and birth. The back wall was pulsing. Breathing. Like the house itself had grown a heart. And I heard… something crawl out. I don’t think I’ll live much longer. I feel it watching me always now. Hating me. Wanting me gone. This morning, the little one drew a picture. It was of the house. But buried under it, drawn in thick black lines… was me. Dead. In the dirt. And beside me was the doll. Grinning. There’s a storm coming. I can feel it in my bones. The air is too heavy. The birds are gone. And the sun… the sun feels like it’s giving up. Tonight, I will wait by her door one last time. If it comes again… I’ll go down fighting. Because I’m a good boy. Even if it means dying. Even if it means staying. Even if it means becoming something else to keep her safe. I will not let it take her. Not while I still have teeth to bite. A heart to beat. A soul to give. Because no one else is listening. But maybe you are. And someone has to remember. What happens when the good boy finally breaks. Thank you all for reading and for joining Duke on this journey. As the story unfolds, let’s see just how far a good boy will go to save his little human.",

      "content": "You know suffering can make any place holy and holy sites don't just exist in the middle east. I went to the red district in Amsterdam and all those women in those red shops, they are suffering and it was so holy. I cried out in joy at how holy it was and one girl in the window, she did the opposite of a stripper. Most strippers start off with clothes and then take them off. This stripper did the opposite. She started off naked and then slowly put clothes on, and then I saw her in her home and it was a bad home life full of violence and oppression. I cried for her but her suffering was so holy and I felt God through her. I felt her patience and perseverance and my faith upholsted even further. The red district is definitely a holy place and the suffering that goes on here, it's fighting against the evils of our world. Then when I saw that stripper again going from nude to wearing clothes, I then saw how she grew up and it was full of neglect and poverty. Yet she is still surviving to this day and age, and I felt God moving through her. Then I went to the most violent place on earth in Mexico Tijuana. I saw so much violence and suffering that my faith went up. I saw bodies hung up on bridges and multiple fights breaking out every 30 minutes. This is a holy city and I saw a man called Eduardo, who spoke the language of violence. A creature named estian whose language is violence. This man had two other guys with him, the other two guys were to fight a certain way, as that is the language estian understands. Eduardo wanted to know how estian was doing. The two guys with Eduardo started to fight each other, and the creature estian understood what Eduardo was asking him, eduardo was asking eduardo how his day was. The creature estian then started to violently attack the two guys, and Eduardo understood what the creature was saying. Estian was fine that day. The most violent place on earth is a holy place and the suffering is truly immense. I felt God presence in this place, and I could never feel gods presence in my rich home town which is based in a 1st world country. Then I went to the red district in Amsterdam, the stripper who starts off nude and then puts on clothes, it went so further back that I saw her in her messed up home full of needles and her baby was not alive. I felt gods presence that day. I wanted to make my house a holy place, and for that I had to make it a place full of suffering. Fancy coming in?",

      "content": "Her body was still covered in frost when she was found. It had taken hours. Even she would have told you that it was a fairly busy street, when she was alive. But where she sat, all alone, silently weeping and sobbing through cries that never escaped her cold lips, it was unnaturally empty. Clouded eyes look at the new day's warm sun as condensation begins to cause little drops of water to slide down her cheeks. \"It was like she was... They looked just like tears.\" That's what the only witness said. And as chilling as it is it was no help in the slightest. Newspapers throughout the whole state running with this idea of some metaphysical danger, before her body was warm or identified. Many found it hard to believe that she was a Jane Doe. She looked like a portrait of the most beautiful actress from the Golden era of Hollywood. \"The Beautiful and The Brutalized!\" was the most mild and tasteful headline of the time. The damage that had been done to her arms and legs were beyond sickening to all witnesses. Crumpled and bloodied with skin delicately draped on like wrapping paper. The rest of her was completely preserved barring her true look of horror. Beautiful pearl earrings and gold bracelets adorned her canvas of skin. All the witnesses thought the same thing: \"Fresh corpse\". Her purse held only a locket with a picture of a man estimated to be taken around 1950, with the words\"The FOOL\" scratched on the back. She was put to rest, as much rest as you can have in such a state, but her killer was never found. Nothing ever came from it, as there was no evidence of anything but a brutal attack, an attack with no known weapons and no known suspects. When years pass without a word being exchanged, then memories begin to fade, even brutal, abhorrent memories. And when memories are forgotten, the Fool is bound to repeat malicious choices. There sits a small sigil in the corner of that alley where that poor creature was found. Sometimes there are flowers, other times candles, sometimes it's vandalized but no one ever fesses up. But I've seen. I've seen it on a snowy night, it is more horrible and amazing than any guesses. And you can see it too-the dream of a young woman asking for protection from the cold and shelter from the coming storm, and a dark cloud wishing to take that all away and more. The outcome relies on you to not repeat the past. Do not become the Fool.",

      "content": "William enjoys getting knocked out and the first time he entered the boxing gym he was scared, nervous and just in general crapping himself. He was fearful of getting knocked out just like everyone else but when he did knocked out, he actually enjoyed it. He e joyed the feeling and experience of getting knocked out. Then he would always want to spar with the toughest guy in the gym, because he had the highest chance of him being knocked out. He enjoyed experiencing the outer body experience through getting knocked out. William was an odd one and I guess he is the one changed the destiny of my gym. William wanted to start having fights and in these boxing fights, he would show his chin to his openents. He would purposely drop his guard and when he got knocked out, he would always have a smile on his face when he came round to conciousness. William was really entertaining the crowd by wanting to get knocked out, and large gatherings started to firm around Williams boxing fights. He started to make good money from these fights and my gym started to get noticed as well. I didn't teach William much boxing, but I just let William be William. Then one day a big boxing promoter came to me about William. I told William that if he signed with this big promoter then he will make loads of money, and he will also face boxers who will give him bigger knock outs. William was all in and in his first big fight, William was showing his chin and purposely boxing all wrong. William was getting worried as he took bog shots but wasn't getting knocked out. He wanted to feel that adrenalin of getting knocked out. After the fight William was disappointed in not getting knocked out. He literally went up to the fight after the fight and knocked him out. William then shouted at the man \"that's what you should have done to me! I wanted to get knocked out you bastard\" and the crowd was cheering for William. William would knock out fighters for failing to knock him out and he even sued a few of his opponents for not knocking him out. Ever since William entered professional boxing with this big promoter, he has never been knocked out and he wants to be knocked out. William doesn't understand how he was always being knocked out before by unprofessional boxers, but now professional boxers can't knock him out anymore. I have something to confess. That big promoter was the devil and William unknowingly signed his soul to always win fights.",

      "content": "I bought a Labubu on a whim. If you’re not familiar, they’re little designer dolls—sort of cute, sort of creepy. Big ears, wide smile, permanent expression like it knows a secret it’s not telling. Mine was Soymilk from the \"Macaron\" line. Pale tan, sweet little monster. I got it from a blind box at a pop-up near my job. It felt like a dumb treat for surviving a rough week. For the first few days, I clipped it to my backpack. People commented on it, most didn’t know what it was. A couple of people lit up and told me how hard they are to get, especially that version. I didn’t think anything of it. It was just a conversation piece. Eventually, I took it off my bag and sat it on my bookshelf, next to a small row of paperbacks and a rock my niece gave me. It stayed there a week. Then it didn’t. The first time it moved, I figured I’d knocked it off. It was lying face-down on the carpet, about a foot from the shelf. I just picked it up and put it back. But the next night, it wasn’t on the shelf. It wasn’t on the floor, either. It was sitting on my desk chair. I live alone. Still, I told myself maybe I’d moved it and forgot. Maybe it slid off and bounced weird. I don’t know. You can justify anything if you don’t want to believe the alternative. I started waking up at odd hours. Not from dreams—just... waking. Once at 2:44 a.m. Another time, 3:12. No sound. No obvious reason. Just that vague, electric sense that something had changed. That you were being looked at. I started finding Soy Milk in different places. Once on the kitchen counter. Once on the bathroom sink. Once—this really messed me up, it was sitting on the edge of the tub. Its body dry, but its ears were wet. I did a full sweep of my apartment. Checked the windows. The locks. I even put tape on the inside of the front door to see if it was being opened while I slept. Nothing moved. No signs of entry. And yet, every morning, the doll was somewhere new. I thought I was losing it. So I set up my phone to record overnight. Just cheap, looped footage. The first two nights, the angle was off. I could barely see the shelf. The third night… it caught something. The video starts normal. Room dim. The doll’s on the shelf. Around 2:07 a.m., the feed glitches briefly—just a stutter. And when it clears, Soy Milk isn’t on the shelf anymore. It’s not on the floor either. It’s just… gone. For four minutes, the room is still. Then, slowly, it appears again. Not crawling. Not walking. Just present. Sitting on my nightstand, like it had always been there. I haven’t recorded since. I keep thinking if I don’t document it, it might stop. Like it wants to be seen. Last night, I woke up to it on my pillow. Our faces were inches apart. I could swear the stitched smile was wider than before. Tonight, I’m locking it in a drawer. If it gets out again… I don’t think I’ll still be the one in charge of this story.",

Just one line of text appeared above the waveform. “We are not done.” I leaned in closer, whispering, “What do you want from me?” The cursor blinked. And blinked. And then, a reply: “Witness.” The waveform zoomed out—and I saw it wasn’t a file. It was a map. Lines, pulses, data spikes. Coordinates. Every person who’d ever listened. Every recording ever played. Every soul it had touched. There were thousands. Then millions. All blinking dots on the screen, forming a shape—a signal web, stretching across the globe. And I was at the center. Then one last window popped open. An option I hadn’t seen before: “Complete Erasure – Irreversible. You will not survive.” Below it: YES / NO I waited. I thought about forwarding it. Saving myself. Letting someone else carry it, like I had. Like Elias had. But I couldn’t do that. This had to end. I clicked YES. The screen shattered into white light. My ears filled with every recording at once—every scream, every breath, every whisper stitched into my mind like a burning brand. And then… Silence. Not just in my room. In the world. I faded. Not into death. Into absence. I wasn’t consumed. I was erased. No memories. No recordings. No voice. And in my place, nothing. No trace. But here’s the thing. You’re reading this.

It grew on me like a mold, fed by the silence and the muffled sound that sometimes rose from the back of the house — a sound that was neither a living thing nor a dead thing. Something between a cry and a gnashing of teeth. Last night, when the kitchen light started flickering like the heart of the house was failing, I went downstairs. The basement door handle was cold as morgue metal, and the key, which I stole from my father's pocket, seemed to vibrate when it touched the lock. The wood creaked like it was screaming, begging me to stop. But I turned the handle. The smell was the first thing that hit me. Rotten, ferrous, damp. The darkness inside was thick, alive—it stuck to the skin like burnt flesh. I went down the creaking steps, one by one, and each step made me hear that sound louder—wet, dragging, like something crawling through slime. Down there, there was meat. Not walls, not floor. Meat. Alive. Palpitating. It pulsed beneath my feet, exhaled steam, trembled to the touch. I saw eyes sewn onto surfaces, lips murmuring things without tongue. Hands came out of cracks and crawled, searching for something — or someone. And in the center… the glowing ball. It floated, huge, pulsating like an inverted uterus, covered in veins and dripping with a foul-smelling yellow liquid. It was as if she were alive, as if she were breathing. I tried to look at her. I tried to understand what it was. That's when she looked back at me. I felt my retina burn. The pain was immediate and excruciating. I felt the blood drain from my eyes, dripping onto the fleshy floor, which drank it in like milk. My teeth started to grind on their own, and my skin… my skin peeled off. He simply let go of me, as if he no longer belonged to me. I fell to my knees, screaming, but the sound was muffled—absorbed by the raw flesh beneath me. Then I heard her voice—not in my ears, but inside my head: \"You were born to see me. You are the bearer of the new flesh.\" When I tried to climb back up, the steps were gone. The basement had closed behind me. The flesh molded around me, tightening, fusing with my raw skin, swallowing me like a tumor swallows healthy tissue. That glowing ball still floats here. Every time I look, it shows more. More than the human eye should see. More than any mind can handle. And now… now I understand why they call her Sol. And why does it burn. Don't look at him. Don't open the door. And for the love of all that still lives... don't come looking for me.",

      "content": "[Dossier retrouvé dans les archives du centre psychiatrique Saint-Cerf – Classé NON COMMUNIQUÉ] Il s’appelait J. L., mais personne ne se souvient de son vrai nom. Ceux qui l’ont connu parlent d’un homme calme, méthodique, trop attentif aux détails. Ce n’est qu’après sa disparition qu’on a lu ce qu’il avait laissé : un carnet noir, griffonné à l’encre sèche, couvert de symboles, de cartes de brume, de noms d’enfants disparus. Selon ses écrits, le brouillard n’était pas un simple phénomène atmosphérique. Pour lui, c’était une entité vivante. Un esprit ancien, sans forme, mais affamé. Il écrivait que le brouillard « choisissait ». Qu’il rôdait dans les quartiers calmes au crépuscule, les soirs où les jeux s’éteignent sans raison. Il notait que les enfants disparaissaient toujours de la même façon. Sans cris. Sans course. Ils s’arrêtaient, le regard dans le vide. Puis ils s’enfonçaient dans la brume, comme s’ils suivaient un fil invisible. Comme si quelque chose les appelait par leur prénom, avec la voix de leur mère… ou pire encore, la leur propre. J. L. affirmait que le brouillard ne laissait jamais de traces. Pas de sang. Pas de vêtements. Seulement un silence anormal, une odeur vague de pierre mouillée, et des jouets encore tièdes. Il avait repéré un cycle. Sept ans. Quarante-sept jours d’intervalle. Toujours entre 17h12 et 17h38. Il en parlait comme d’une respiration. D’un cœur battant sous la peau du monde. Et il écrivait aussi que la ville savait. Qu’un pacte ancien liait les disparitions au calme apparent des rues. Il disait que ce n’était pas un hasard si personne ne parlait longtemps des enfants perdus. Que le brouillard emportait aussi les souvenirs gênants. Il appelait cela la paix du monstre. Son dernier message, inscrit à même le mur de sa chambre, disait ceci : « Si tu entends frapper, et que l’on t’appelle par ton prénom… n’ouvre pas. Ce n’est pas toi, là-dehors. Ce n’est plus toi. » Depuis, personne n’a rouvert cette chambre. Mais les enfants recommencent à disparaître. Et le brouillard revient.",

      "content": "Last weekend my truck broke down on the side of the road and I ended up calling roadside assistance. They told me that it would take a few hours to get it to the nearest shop, but there was a small town 20 minutes away with air bnbs, hotels and family owned inns. My friends agreed to uber with me to this town and find somewhere we could crash for the night, and that we would chip in for the uber to get to the truck In the morning. When we arrived into town we grabbed a quick bite to eat at a quaint little coffee shop and then quickly scanned the web for some cheap hotel deals. It didn’t take long for our server to notice what we were doing, and she took it upon herself to tell us about a local bnb hosted by some lady from her church. We all had a group discussion and decided that we would go inquire about prices and the number of rooms/beds. When we got to the house we were pleasantly surprised. It was a two story cottage with a beautiful front yard covered in flowers and creeping vines. I gave the front door a few knocks and stepped back, patiently waiting for the owners to open it. The bnb turned out to be perfect. There were three guest rooms. Two with two beds and one with a nice double. Once we’d settled in we all got dressed up and headed out for a few drinks. We laughed and sang with locals for hours and it was great fun, until we heard a commotion outside the back door of the bar. The bartender quickly disappeared and reappeared within seconds. He told the door-staff to close and lock the door immediately, trapping us all inside. “What the f-, what is going on” I yelled. The bartender looked me dead in the eyes and said “you see how the locals aren’t making a sound? Look around you. They are scared. The bitch won’t die.” I asked him what he was talking about and he just shook his head and looked at the bar. Shortly after people began to pray in unison. They started out quiet, but then when the banging on the front door began they prayed louder, and louder. I ran over to the window and looked toward the door. A woman was tugging at it. She was crying and wailing. Then she began to bang on it again. The bartender assured me that soon she will tire and wander back to her grave. At around 11:45 the banging stopped, and a few minutes later the bartender began pouring drinks again. He unlocked the door at 12:30 and everyone poured out of the bar and dragged themselves back to wherever they came from. The next morning we sat and had breakfast with the lady running the air bnb. She was very talkative and eager to know how our night was, and so we told her about the lockdown at the bar. The old woman lifted her head and smiled. “Ah renè” she said. She laughed lightly and continued to speak. “Renè was a young lady, very smart, very talented. She had access to things we didn’t. The townspeople assumed she was a witch and used to bother her to no end, always banging on her door and yelling at her window. When she fell into the river and passed they celebrated, but that night she rose from her grave, and now it is her turn to bother them. They deserve it. They buried her in a half arsed grave and her family were not notified. Anyway, safe travels!” After hearing this we quickly finished our coffee and arranged for a ride out of town. I gave the bnb five stars. The beds were extremely comfortable.",

      "content": "My name is Olivia and Amanda and I have been friends since high school. Even though we moved to different cities in college, we stayed in touch. She became a journalist in New York, while I started teaching in Chicago. We would meet a few times a year and text almost every day. When I went to the doctor with constant pain and fatigue in my leg, the diagnosis was grave: Hodgkin's lymphoma. Fortunately, it had been detected early and was a treatable form of cancer, but a grueling course of chemotherapy awaited me. Amanda was the first person I called. I cried and shared the news and she told me she was so sorry and that she would \"be there for me no matter what\". The first week was really supportive. We were texting and video calling every day. But two weeks after the chemotherapy started, her texts became less frequent. He was saying, \"I'm very busy, I'm working on a big story.\" I understood, of course he had his own life and career. When my hair started to fall out, I sent him a photo and he only replied with a heart emoji. When I was spending long periods of time in the hospital, I would see photos of him on Instagram, taken at parties with his old university friends. Once, when I called him, he hung up saying, “I'm not available right now,” and half an hour later he posted a party photo. He said he would come to visit, but he always found an excuse. One day I saw a comment on Facebook from our mutual friend Stephanie: \"Amanda, that's terrible what you said about Olivia's condition. I'm sure it's not that bad.\" I sent Stephanie a private message and asked her what Amanda had said. Stephanie hesitated at first, then sent me screenshots. Amanda had written to her group of friends that I was “constantly giving off negative energy”, that I might be “exaggerating my illness for attention” and that I was a “drama queen”. She even said, “I need to take a break, the constant illness talk is making me depressed.” Towards the end of chemotherapy, he suddenly called me one day. “Did you get good news?” he asked cheerfully. She acted as if she had never been away, as if she was always there for me. I realized then that Amanda was a friend who only existed in happy moments. She wanted to be part of my recovery story, but she wasn't there for the difficulties. I survived cancer, but our 15-year friendship has not. Now I have a much smaller but real circle of friends. And I know the value of people who can stay by your side not only in the good times but also in the darkest times. Check out more True Best Friend Horror Stories",

      "content": "Be Careful Which Streaming Stick You Buy (Lost Broadcast / Found Footage Creepypasta) [Recovered footage begins inside a cluttered living room] Duke slouches deep in a worn-out recliner, the remote gripped loosely in his hand like it’s a lifeline. Cathy-Sue settles beside him on the threadbare couch, a half-empty beer in one hand, popcorn spilling over the armrest. The TV flickers to life. Duke: “Alright, Cathy, lemme see if this thing’s worth the shady-ass deal I made at the gas station.” He clicks through channels. Static, weird fuzz. Then an ad pops up—too bright, too fake. Ad Voice #1 (cheerfully ominous): “Need fast cash? Have two eyes? Why not sell one? Appendages fetch a pretty penny these days!” Ad Voice #2 (gleeful, almost mocking): “Dumb kids’ toys? Head down to Fers’ Toy Cave! Ask for Luci! Heat-seeking lawn darts are back in stock. Fun for the whole family!” Duke chuckles nervously, flipping onward. Screen switches to a warped sitcom: “Married with Medical Experiments” Peggy, slouched and half-eaten popcorn in hand, mutters: Peggy: “Oh, Al... did you sell what’s left of Bud’s brain again? Thought Kelly’s goat graft paid for those new tires?” Hal (breaking the fourth wall, deadpan): “Hey Peggy, how’s about we shave your head? There’s enough left to fill a ward’s mattresses.” Laughter track? Nope. Just unsettling silence and a low hum of something wrong. Channel flips again. The number “3” blazes in red. A panicked news anchor screams: “We’re drilling for souls downtown! A demon’s loose and wants to speak to someone in charge! Emergency crews are fleeing!” Duke snorts. Cathy-Sue’s eyes narrow. Then the channel shifts again. “American Home Makeovers: Extreme Repossession Edition” A rusted truck rumbles onto the screen, dragging a trailer festooned with broken doll heads and power tools. Host #1 (yelling): “Well, folks! Tonight, we’re bringing a special makeover to Duke and Cathy-Sue’s humble abode!” Camera pans to Duke and Cathy-Sue’s own front yard — a flamingo lawn ornament is split in half by a chainsaw-wielding maniac wearing a baby doll mask. Inside, Duke and Cathy-Sue stare slack-jawed, popcorn halfway to mouths. Suddenly — a frantic banging at the door. Static. The feed glitches. [Text on screen]: “Broadcast interrupted. Location unknown. Contact lost.” [Uploader’s comment:] Found this buried on a flash drive marked “DO NOT OPEN” in an abandoned gas station parking lot. No trace of Duke, Cathy-Sue, or the crew. If you ever come across a streaming stick from a stranger, maybe just... don’t. Reddit Thread: “Found Broadcast – Be Careful Which Streaming Stick You Buy” you/ShadyStreamHunter: “Dude, this is why you NEVER buy tech from sketchy gas station dudes. That ad about selling your eyes? Legit gave me chills. Who writes this stuff?” you/PopcornGhoul: “I swear I caught a glimpse of that baby mask guy standing behind Duke and Cathy-Sue for a second. How the hell did this not get reported?” you/SkepticSue: “Okay, I’m all for creepy stories but… was that a chainsaw flamingo massacre or did I need more sleep? Someone send help.” you/CaffeineZombie: “I’m binge-watching this and now I’m scared to look at my TV. Also, WTF did I just read?!

      "content": "I bought a used copy of Pokémon Emerald from a flea market. The cartridge was a little scratched, but it booted up fine. The seller said it belonged to his son, who hadn’t played in years. When I turned it on, there was already a save file: Name: \"…\" Time Played: 999:59 Pokédex: 0 That was odd. No Pokémon registered after nearly 1,000 hours? I almost deleted the file, but curiosity got the better of me. I loaded it. I appeared in Oldale Town, but it was nighttime — something Emerald wasn’t supposed to simulate graphically. Everything was tinted blue, and the music was... off. Slowed down, distorted. My character's sprite wasn’t the default Brendan or May. It was a silhouette — just a black shape with red eyes. The Trainer Card listed no badges, no money, no Pokémon. Just one line: \"He never stopped playing.\" I checked the PC in the house. The \"Item Storage\" was empty, but \"Mailbox\" had one message: From: [UNKNOWN] “Don’t look behind you.” I backed out of the menu, and my character turned around automatically — facing the screen, as if looking at me. Then he moved on his own, walking outside. The overworld was… dead. No NPCs. No wild Pokémon. Every building was locked. I tried to fly, but I had no Pokémon. No map. The only thing I could do was walk — and the only direction open was north. I wandered for a while, finding nothing but empty towns. Littleroot. Petalburg. Rustboro. All abandoned. No music. Just wind. Eventually, I entered Mt. Pyre. It was the only place with people. Sort of. The NPCs here looked wrong — their faces were corrupted, eyes missing, arms too long, heads twitching. When I approached, they only said: “He’s still here.” “He won’t let you go.” “You’re Player Two now.” At the summit, there was a tombstone with a prompt: \"Read the name?\" I selected YES. It said: “YOU.” Then the game glitched hard — screen flashing, unreadable characters filling the textbox. My character fell through the floor, and I was dropped into a black void. A new message appeared: \"You can’t delete him.\" I reset the game. But now, even on the main menu, there was no “New Game” option. Only “Continue.” The save file name had changed to: “YOU” Time Played: 000:00 I loaded it once more. The screen was black except for one figure in the distance — the silhouette. My old character. He didn’t move. As I approached, he turned and spoke: “I was the first. You’re next.” Then the game shut off. Not just closed — powered down my entire system. I haven’t been able to open that ROM again. It just crashes. But every once in a while, when I play other Pokémon games, I’ll find something strange in my party — a Pokémon I didn’t catch, named \"…\", with a glitched sprite and the message: “He remembers you.” And I can never release it.",

      "content": "You ever hear about places where the trees seem alive? Not in the fairy tale way, but like they’re watching you, waiting? The kind of place that makes your skin crawl the moment you step inside? That’s what the Whispering Woods are like. I wasn’t supposed to be there. Honestly, I didn’t believe half the stories. But curiosity got the best of me—and maybe some stupid pride. It was a cold October evening when I and three friends decided to explore the forest on the edge of our town. Everyone warned us not to go past the old trail, but we laughed it off. “It’s just woods,” we said. “What’s the worst that could happen?” By the time we reached the entrance, the sun was dipping below the horizon, the sky painted in angry reds and purples. The air smelled like wet leaves and something else—something faintly metallic and wrong. We joked as we walked deeper into the trees, but the laughter faded fast. The deeper we went, the quieter it got. Not just quiet—unnaturally silent. No birds. No rustling animals. Just a heavy, suffocating stillness. Then, the whispers started. At first, we thought it was the wind. You know, those soft sounds leaves make when they brush together. But the whispers were different. Soft voices calling names. My name. My friends’ names. “Jess… Mark… Alex…” We froze. I looked around. No one else was there. My heart slammed in my chest. We tried to turn back, but the trail seemed to twist and change. Trees moved—or at least, that’s what it felt like. Paths we swore we came from were gone. Instead, new ones appeared, leading us deeper. One by one, my friends started hearing things, too. Snatches of voices—laughter, crying, pleading. Alex stopped walking and stared at a patch of fog swirling at the base of a huge, gnarled oak. “There,” he said quietly. “I see something.” We stepped closer. In the fog, faint faces appeared—blurred, distorted, but unmistakably human. They seemed trapped, reaching out silently. Mark took a step back, white as a ghost. “We need to get out of here.” But then the ground beneath us groaned. The trees creaked, leaning closer, blocking the light. The whispers grew louder, angry now, desperate. Suddenly, the air went icy cold. Alex screamed and dropped his flashlight—it shattered. Panic exploded. We ran. Branches snagged at our clothes, thorny vines scraping our skin. The voices chased us, echoing in every direction, growing louder, drowning out our screams. When we finally burst out of the woods, it was dawn. But Alex was gone. We searched for hours, calling his name, but no trace. Some say the Whispering Woods claim those who listen too closely. I never went back. Sometimes, late at night, I still hear his voice, faint and desperate, carried on the wind. “Help me…”",

      "title": "Six Bullets, Six Stooges",
      "content": "Back in the day I used to date a beautiful young lady, who happened to be Larry Fine’s great-granddaughter. I think it was around 1988 or 89 when this young lady’s grandmother, Larry’s daughter, passed away. I helped my girlfriend sort through her grandmother’s stuff, helped clean the house, etcetera. As you might guess, there was quite a bit of Three Stooges ephemera and memorabilia lying around. In return for my help, the family offered to let me keep some of it. I was too young to really have much affection for Larry and the gang, but to be polite I filled a box with some random crap from the basement and took it home. It wasn’t until the next day that I bothered to look at what I’d taken. Beneath the folderol, bric-a-brac, and faded photos of Larry there was a film canister labelled “Six Bullets, Six Stooges (1973)”. Six of them? And didn’t ’73 seem kind of late for a Stooges film? As I said, I was no hardcore Stooge head, but I knew a bit of the history from my girlfriend. In fact, I was pretty sure that Curly was long dead by ’73. Maybe Shemp too. Intrigued, I decided I needed to see what was on that film reel. If this was a forgotten Stooges flick lost to time, I might have some serious moolah on my hands. This being LA, finding an old projector to play the film didn’t take long. I decided to watch it first alone, not even telling my girlfriend about it. A handwritten title card flashed “Six Stooges, Six Bullets”, then a shot of a plain studio soundstage. The film stock was a bit grainy, but I could clearly make out marching into frame Larry, Curly, Shemp, Curly Joe, and Joe Besser, with Moe bringing up the rear. All six Stooges, together in one forgotten film! I was gonna be stinking rich! The five subordinate Stooges stand in a row while Moe gives them each the once over. With an air of determination, or perhaps resignation, Moe pulls out a shiny silver revolver and intones “Six bullets, six Stooges” before raising the gun to Joe Besser’s temple and firing. Even though it’s in black and white, the blood looks real to me. Joe crumples in a heap to the studio floor. Moe moves down the line. “Six bullets, six Stooges.” Next to go is Curly Joe. Skull fragments whiz toward the camera. “Six bullets, six Stooges.” Pow! Shemp is now limp, dead. Larry waits with eyes are closed, almost serene. “Six bullets, six Stooges.” Moe fires and Larry’s eyes look less serene once they are dangling from their obliterated sockets. Curly looks as if he might burst into childish tears, but says nothing. Moe repeats his murderous mantra: “Six bullets, six Stooges.” Bang! Curly briefly, lethargically, attempts to spin on the floor as his lifeblood drains away. Moe approaches the camera until his face fills the frame, his gaze razor sharp. “No one will ever believe you saw this, ya knucklehead.” With a wild, blazing grin Moe raises the revolver to his own head. “Six bullets, six Stooges.” Bang! End of film. Too stunned to stop the projector, I sat in a daze until the smell of acrid, chemical smoke brought me back to reality. The film reel was up in flames. Only ashes remained. I stopped answering my girlfriend’s calls until she eventually got the message and broke up with me. I knew Moe was right, nobody would ever believe me.",

      "content": "Voss files – special report: “Black Breath” Classified: V-Index Level 3 – Thanatogen Relevance Author: Chief Inspector M. Richter (missing, status: probably infected) I am Chief Inspector M. Richter. I don't know how much longer I can last. Maybe this is my confession... or my warning. The operation began as routine: an emergency call from a disused warehouse on the outskirts of the city. Supposedly screaming, suspicious activity. I was traveling with my partner Patrick. Solid guy. Always a saying on your lips. What we found was not routine. It was a leak. No gas – but history. Repressed, sealed, forgotten. The hall smelled of death. Not decayed, but burned. Metallic. Sterile. And underneath, something else… something that I can only describe as alive today. Inside: Fog, thicker than normal. A man - probably a technician - with blackened skin, bleeding eyes, wheezing. Black blood, tar-like. In retrospect, I recognize the symptoms: PX2009 contamination. A mutated, aerosol-based variant. Noted in the Voss files as “X-Virus / Thanatogen B.731 – The Black Breath”. On the walls: Cyrillic warning signs. Damaged canisters with the symbol ΔX, underneath the name “Черный Дыхание”. The Black Breath. A prototype, presumably developed as part of the Thanatogen program. Probably from one of the missing external laboratories. My partner was infected first. Within minutes: shortness of breath, nosebleeds, hallucinations. I saw something whispering into him, through him. I fled - but I think I took it with me. Analysis of recording by S3: Substance description: Aerosol virus, highly infectious, neurotoxic. Effect: Destruction of the areas of the brain responsible for fear and reality recognition. Symptoms: Black nosebleeds, psychotic episodes, fatal respiratory arrest. Last known deployment: Russia, 1996 – Project name: “Порог” (The Threshold) Connection to Voss/X virus: Confirmed. ΔX symbol identical to symbols from cases A-04 and B-12. “B.731” identical to project name from USB video in file #7. Last recorded words from Commissioner Richter (transcription, video damaged): \"It's not the gas that kills. It's what comes with you. The whispers. The shadows. Voss never stopped. He…breathes through us.”",

      "content": "My friend who I hadn't been in contact with for about 2 years, he messaged on social media out of the blue. I was happy to see his name pop up on Facebook and we talked about our lives and all of the ups and downs that comes with it. Then randomly my friend, who is called Simon, he tells me about an urban legend surrounding Google Street view. I had never heard of any urban legend surrounding google Street view but I was interested. Now I did find it highly random that Simon would suddenly want to start talking about an urban legend surround google street view, after we were just talking about our lives. Simon told me that every place that's on google Street image, has a dead body buried inside it. He then started going on about how Google Street view can only take pictures of places that has a dead body buried underneath it, and for any place to basically exist right now in this era, google Street view must be able to take a picture of it. I was a bit lost at what he was going on about but then Simon sent me a link of a google street view image. It showed me an empty piece of land where a guy in a hooded grey coat jacket, had shot and killed another guy. Even the blood splatter got pictured by Google Street view. Simon then told me that a secretive group of individuals get hired from around the world, to basically kill people so that Google Street view could take a picture of the place, so that particular place could exist in this era. I obviously didn't believe him and he then sent me a link to another random google street view of another empty piece of land. \"I bet you there will be a body under this piece of land\" simon wanting me to bet with him \"Alright if there's a body under that land where Google Street view has taken a picture of, then I will pay you a hundred quid\" I told Simon \"It's a done deal\" simon replied to me Now Google Street view should have never taken a picture of that guy wearing a grey hooded jacket murdering another person, it usually waits for the murderer to bury the dead, but occasionally it doesn't wait. Any how Simon is a pretty technical computer savvy guy and he is very good with geography. He found the exact place of that empty piece of land. He got out 2 shovels and we both dug at the exact point where Google Street view has an image of it. To my horror I couldn't believe that there was an actual dead body in it. It was a male and it hadn't fully decomposed and Simon took the deceased guys wallet so he could figure out who this guy was. We both just filled the hole and went home. Simon called me after he found out everything about the dead guy, he was crying as well. \"That dead guy was such a nice guy and he had such a wonderful life. I can't believe he got killed so that google Street view could take a picture of the land for it to exist in our era\" simon cried out to me I remember just sitting in the dark and just staring into the empty void. My thoughts were empty and I couldn't believe what I had just experienced. Then Simon sent me another random google street view image of another empty land. We made the same bet and simon found the exact same spot, and when we both got there both of us were digging into the ground, I couldn't believe that we found another dead body. It was a woman this time. Similar like the last body it hadn't fully decomposed and Simon took her wallet, so that he could find out who she was. Simon called me when we both got home and he was crying his eyes out for her. He kept telling me how much of a wonderful person she was and how she was adored by all her students. Simon cried in a really weird way and I just couldn't handle it after a while. Then once again I was just sitting sitting in the dark, while looking outside at night time. I saw how calm everything was even though I had just experienced something horrible for the second time. Then Simon sent me another google street view image of another empty land and we made the same bet for the third time. I owe Simon 200 quid at this point. Simon then took me to the exact place and land, and we both dug into the ground. We couldn't find any dead body and I was happy, but then Simon said \"google Street view needs a dead body for it to be able to take a picture of it, so that this land could exist in this era. That means someone needs to die\" As I tried to get out Simon pulled me to the ground and he smiled at me. \"I made all that up\" simon told me Then I noticed his grey hooded coat jacket, it's the same one on google Street view image that he first sent me. Simon's a serial killer. Then as Simon was about to kill me I told Simon \"I still need to pay what I owe you! I've got no cash but I have online banking on my phone\" As I successfully managed to stall some time and pretending to be on my back app, I hit Simon with my shovel and knock him out cold. I get out of the hole and fill the hole. I am now just sitting in my room all alone in the dark. What the fuck did I just experience?",

      "content": "I was never the type to believe in internet stories. \"Creepypastas\", as they call them... always seemed to me to be just poorly written fiction by bored teenagers. But what I found in the abandoned hospital in my city... there is no other word than curse. Psychiatric Unit 13 at Hospital São Martinho was closed in the 1990s, after a fire destroyed part of the upper floor. They say all the patients burned to death — except one. A man known only by his medical record number: #013. No identity, no history, nothing but clinical reports describing hysterical fits of laughter and talk of “tearing other people’s consciences from the inside.” I decided to explore the place with my friend Leandro, who always took a GoPro for these adventures. We found damp hallways, mold on the walls, broken syringes on the floor. But it was in the basement that everything started to go wrong. The door was locked with chains, but someone had recently broken the padlock. We enter. The air was thick and hot like the breath of something dying. At the end of the corridor, there was a single room lit by red lamps: Containment Room 13. Inside it, there was a rusty stretcher, dark stains on the walls... and dozens of eyes drawn with dried blood. On the ceiling, a sentence written with deep cuts in the wood itself: \"They don't die when they bleed. They die when you see.\" Before I could understand, Leandro was already filming everything, laughing. Laughing like the descriptions in the medical record. He pointed to the stretcher and said: — Lay there. I want to open you up... just a little. Just to see if your thoughts also flow. I tried to run, but the door was gone. The walls were closing in. Leandro took a scalpel out of his pocket — where did he get it from? — and walked forward with the camera still recording. When he hit me in the shoulder, I screamed and the light bulb exploded. Darkness. Silence. And then… the sound of flesh being slowly cut, as breathing mixed with the sound of short, wet laughter. I passed out. When I woke up, I was in the middle of the street, naked, with symmetrical cuts across my body and the word \"OPEN\" carved into my abdomen. Leandro was never found. But days later, a video appeared on obscure deep web forums. It showed Room 13. It showed my body being opened like a flower, and a voice behind the camera saying, “The eyes on the inside see better.” The police never confirmed anything. The hospital was demolished soon after. But sometimes I receive anonymous emails. All with the same title: \"Record #014 — Under observation.\" And inside... just videos. Always with the same red lighting. Always someone new shouting.",

      "content": "So my Cousin Gabriella just died a month ago, so yesterday I was cleaning out her house and I found the following doc on her computer, she Had recently been released from a mental hospital but this is so similar to what happened to her, stabbed, and half eaten. Let me know what ya’ll think about it It all started one afternoon. I was seven years old and just living my best life, I was happy, I had friends, and great parents. I was just playing in my bedroom like a normal kid when I left for a minute to get a snack, but when I came back, something had changed. My favorite doll had the word “Help” scrawled on her arm. I wrote back a simple childlike response. “Yes” Then The writing appeared on the napkin I brought for my snack. “He’s Coming.” “Who’s Coming?” I wrote back. “Jagged Jared” before I could think of a response it wrote again “He killed me” I was shocked and the word “Run” appeared on the napkin. I believed it was all some kind of practical joke and kept playing until nightfall, but then all of a sudden in a shaky handwriting the words “I’m Here Gabriella” appeared on the page. All of the responses ran through my head but I simply wrote “No” and I ran through the house locking every door and ran back to my room, where the words “I’m eating your mom’s... Leftovers” appeared on the page and I just sat there confused. But then the words “I’m In your parent’s room” appeared. “You can’t go in there!” I responded. The next message terrified me.”Your dad tastes good.” My seven year old mind broke. “YOU ATE MY DAD!?” I wrote then he said “Your mom is a bit chewy” I couldn’t believe it, I was an Orphan. But I knew I was Next. I climbed out of my window and tried to get in the car but it was still locked. I broke through the downstairs window to run inside and get the car keys, getting covered in blood in the process. Then I saw him. He was tall, but not too tall, just taller than my dad. He had long black claws on his hands and feet, and wore a large black suit. He had yellow eyes like that of a cat, a lot of stubble, fangs, and long black hair. And worst of all a ring or my parent’s wet blood around his mouth. He chased me but I jumped back out the window into the car and started driving. But the thing is... I was a seven year old driving. I dropped a brick on the gas and got as far away from Jared as possible... before getting pulled over. The officer pulling me over asked why I was driving a car at 11 pm because letting me drive was considered child neglect. I told him my parents were dead and I described Jared to the officer but the sketch that came out definitely made him not believe me. They sent a detective crew into the house, but it was almost like Jared wasn’t there, and since I was covered in blood from the window, and was the last to use the knife other than Jared that was used to kill my parents, I got the blame. So here I am, 20 years later writing this story. I just got released from Broughton Hospital and am finally free to live my life almost like a normal person again. But it’s still haunting me... what if Jared comes Back? Wait.. what’s that... there’s a knock on the door... brb if I don’t continue writing... you’ll know what happened. And if you find this story. Please post it as a warning. That Jared is out there, and he will strike again",

      "content": "The Voss files My name is Tomas M., field agent at the State Criminal Police Office. I'm actually responsible for other things - undercover investigations, surveillance, access. But the staff shortage forced all of us to perform tasks that were far outside our usual responsibilities. I was assigned to S3 – Forensic Science. The reason was water damage in the archive basement. My job: Reviewing old case files – checking, cataloging, archiving or destroying. Routine. I thought. Until I found the box. No official file number, no seal, no proof of origin. Just one word, roughly written on the box in black Sharpie: “VOSS” At first I thought it was a mistake. Maybe a binder, misfiled. But when I opened the lid, it smelled... wrong. Not like mildew or wet paper. It smelled like metal. After hospital. Cold, sterile – and still spoiled. There were old, soaked files in the box, some sealed, others with dried blood stains. At the bottom: a clear plastic bag. Contents: a USB stick labeled \"Case recordings. Only for SOKO Thanatogen.\" Next to it is a vial with the inscription: A virus PX2009 I should have reported it. I know. But curiosity is the beginning of all damnation. File #1 – Victim A-04 / “Smiling Death” Markus K., male, 32 years old Cause of death: suicide - due to a deep cut with broken glass on his own throat. Witness statement: “He was smiling.” The toxicology report spoke of neuronal stimulus enhancers and hallucinogenic mushroom compounds. Note: A man in a black protective suit with a gas mask and welding goggles was seen nearby. A poisonous green symbol on his suit: “☣️☢️” File #3 – Victim B-12 / “Wordless” Marina S., female, 19 years old Found in a locked classroom - no external injuries. Written on the wall, in chalk: “I heard him sing.” Autopsy: death from cerebral overheating. The brain was basically “burnt”. Next to her: an empty metal syringe. Still warm. File #7 – Investigator Reuter Lost. His last log entry was barely decipherable. Sketches of a laboratory, an upside down symbol for “life”. Below that is the sentence: \"He doesn't create poisons. He deletes realities.\" Then there was the video on the USB stick. A laboratory. Cold. Mute. A man sits at the table, his back to the camera. In front of him: body parts in liquid. He speaks calmly, almost casually: \"Knowledge is not what saves us. It is what breaks us.\" Then he turns around. Gas mask. Welding goggles. He says, \"Experiment A-418 is complete. I will continue with B.731.\" Since then, I have reviewed additional old case files. Over half a dozen with striking similarities. A name kept appearing - not official, not confirmed, but passed on in whispers in the dark corners of the city: X virus He is said to have been active since 2005. The timing was right - from then on the Voss experiments disappeared from all databases. Only the traces remained: mutilated bodies, insane victims, substances that do not seem to come from this world. I am convinced: X-Virus is Voss. Submerged. But never disappeared. I spoke to contacts in the underworld, asked for information. They asked around – too much, as it turned out. One by one they were found dead. And then the letter came. In my apartment. No sender, no fingerprints. \"Stop. Or you'll share her fate.\" I should have stopped. But I can't. Because I now know: What is in the Voss files is not the past. It's a whisper from hell - Voss isn't finished. And I won't rest until I find him. And hunt down.",

      "content": "You know that debate that was all over social media a while back? “If you’re alone in the woods, would you rather run into a bear… or a man?” Yeah. That. Well, it actually happened to me. It was a Wednesday. I was on forced paid vacation because apparently working 70-hour weeks was “a liability” for the company, but God forbid they actually pay us overtime. So there I was, midweek, with nothing to do and no one around. I figured, “Screw it, let me go camping.” Yeah, yeah — feel free to judge me for going alone. But at that point, boredom was worse than fear. The weather forecast said it would be cloudy. That’s it. Cloudy. So imagine my surprise when I was halfway through setting up my tent and the sky decided to absolutely shit itself. Like, full biblical flood. Cats, dogs, and possibly raccoons. I panicked, started ripping the tent out of the ground, trying to save what I could. I ran to the car—two flat tires. Two. Not one. Just my luck. Earlier, I’d seen a couple camping maybe half a mile away when I drove in, so I threw on my emergency poncho (I had cut holes into a black trash bag) and started walking. I was never good with directions. That, and the rain turned everything into a swirling mess of mud and shadows. It got darker. Like, movie-dark, the kind where you expect something to pop out of the trees and maul you. And something did. At first, I saw rustling up ahead and thought, Thank God, maybe the couple heard me. I shouted, “Hey! Hey, I need help!” Big mistake. Because what stepped out of the brush wasn’t a person. It was a fucking black bear. Probably five feet tall at the shoulder, soaking wet, staring at me like I owed it money. I froze. It didn’t. It charged. It was chaos. Claws, teeth, roaring. I felt something rip through my side. I remember hitting the ground hard, my leg twisted at the wrong angle. Everything was pain and rain and noise. Then nothing. When I came to, I wasn’t dead — not yet. I was bleeding out, soaked, too tired to move. I thought that was it. Then I heard footsteps. Not heavy like the bear’s. Lighter. More deliberate. It was the guy from the couple I saw earlier. At first, I thought I was saved. I even smiled. But he didn’t smile back. The last thing I saw before blacking out again was his boot heading straight for my face. When I woke up, I was tied to a table. Naked. Cold. Everything hurt, but it was the wrong kind of pain — like things had already been done to me. The guy stood at the end of the table. The woman was there too, silent, just watching. She never spoke, not once. I won’t give you every detail. Let’s just say: if the bear had eaten me, it would’ve been a mercy. What they did… It wasn’t about hunger. It was about control. But eventually, it did become about hunger. They started taking pieces of me. First, my foot. I remember the crunch — like someone stepping on dry leaves. They were impressed with the flavor. Then came the leg. That one took them longer. They were careful with it, like it was a prized cut. The day they were going to take my arm, the cops burst in. Turns out, they’d been tracking missing people for months. Dozens had vanished in those woods. I was lucky. If you can even call it that. I’d been missing for a month. A whole month. So much for vacation. So yeah, when people online start that whole debate again — “Would you rather run into a bear or a man in the woods?” I say: fuck both. They’re both monsters. One just pretends to be human. And honestly, I don’t care what you think is scarier. Because sometimes, fear isn’t about choosing between bad and worse — it’s just about knowing you’re completely powerless, and no one’s coming. So be afraid. Not of the woods. Not of the bear. Not of the man. Be afraid of how easy it is to disappear. And how no one really notices until it’s too late.",

      "content": "When I first became rich I didn't feel happy or powerful. Nor did I feel like showing off and buying things, but I did feel naked. Yes that's right I felt naked when I first became rich and it's not a nice feeling. On the road to becoming rich I was first clothed with all my good morals and then chasing after money, I unknowingly took off my good morals and so that's why I felt naked when I first became rich, because I had to go against all my good morals to become rich. Back then I was living in a communist state. Now you are all even more confused as to how I could become rich in a communist state. I had a lot of connections in medicine, housing and education. So when people came to me for either of those 3 things, they gave me presents, bribes and money in which I accepted. I didn't really realise how I was becoming naked from my good morals for accepting these things, but it felt good. It felt good being rich in a communist country and everyone needed me to get the best education, medicine and housing. Then when I felt naked from being rich, I assumed it was what Adam and eve felt when they ate the apple in the garden. I noticed my nakedness from my good morals. Now in a communist state everything belongs to the state, and everyone's hard work belongs to the state. That also means that no matter who works harder or slower, everyone gets the same. That means everyone is each other and when I killed someone, that wasn't murder but rather suicide as everyone is the same. I felt good and redeemed and I didn't feel naked anymore from my good morals. The circle keeps going forward and I end up doing the same thing. I started to take bribes to become rich and in doing so I became naked from my good morals. I felt ashamed and I wanted to feel that warmth from my good morals again. So I shot someone but we are all one and the same in a communist state, so it was a suicide. Then after I was redeemed again I felt good. I was clothed again with all my good morals. Then the communist state collapsed and I had to immigrate. I then had to get a job as a cleaner and I have been a cleaner ever since. Chasing money will make you naked from your morals.",

      "content": "Мы с братом, как всегда возвращались из соседнего города от своих родителей домой. Заправив, полный бак и канистру, мы отправились в путь. Уже темнело, но дорога не долгая, около двух часов езды по пересечённой местности. Ехали молча, я в своё окно наблюдал, как садится солнце и думал о своем, а брат был полностью сконцентрирован на дороге. Он никогда не ехал быстро в темное время суток. Спустя час сумерки заменила ночь, сотовая связь перестала поступать в мой телефон, а моё внимание захватила аварийная сигнализация впереди. Когда мы подъехали ближе, нами была обнаружена оставленная машина в кювете, передняя часть кузова разбита всмятку о дерево, а две передние двери открыты – внутри горел свет, поэтому было сразу понятно, что в автомобиле никого нет. Мы решили остановиться и проверить на наличие необходимости в нашей помощи. Осмотревшись, мы никого не обнаружили и, было, готовились продолжить путь, но планы прервала молодая пара. Мужчина и девушка – лет по 25 - 30, одеты они были в стиле 80-х, что я сразу оценил. Это была их машина. Поговорили мы – помощь не требуется, они нас уверили, что им поможет местный фермер с соседней деревни, до которой ещё минут 5 дороги. Со спокойной совестью, мы сели в машину, но мотор не заводился. Причину не пришлось долго искать – пустой бензобак. Странно... Визуально бензобак не был повреждён, поэтому было решено просто заправиться из канистры и продолжить путь. Занявшись необходимостью, мы не обнаружили никаких следов пары – они пропали также внезапно, как и появились. Мы решили не акцентировать на этом внимание. Честно признаться, уже стало жутко и я не хотел нагнетать обстановку, брат был со мной согласен. Мы проехали деревню. Разговоров о том, что произошло не было – ехали молча, я смотрел в окно. Когда брат резко дёрнул руль в лево, я чуть не ударился о боковое стекло. Он резко совершил манёвр, будто кого-то или что-то объехал и затормозил. \"Там была та девчонка\" – сказал он мне. Я оглянулся, но на дороге никого не было. \"Ты уверен?\" – переспросил я, отстёгивая ремень. Я вышел из машины, включил фонарик на телефоне, чтобы осмотреться. В трёх-четырёх метрах вдоль всей полосы лежала доска целиком избитая гвоздями. \"Что бы тебе не показалось, оно сэкономило нам несколько часов и кучу нервов\" (Забегая вперёд, я очень сильно смеялся, когда понял, что переживать стоило далеко не о времени и нервах) – я вернулся в машину и мы продолжили путь. Он уверял – там была именно та девушка, но я немного скептично отнёсся к его разговорам, однако предложил посмотреть запись на регистраторе, когда будем дома. Дома же, на видео мы действительно увидели девушку – она была в размытом качестве, можно было разглядеть грязь на одежде, её лицо было очень тёмным, я не уверен, что там что-то осталось от лица, а руки... С руками всё не так просто. Рука была в чём-то тёмном, то ли в грязи, то ли в крови и указывала в сторону от дороги, вторую руку видно не было. На этом мы с братом разошлись. Я сел на свой байк, который был припаркован в его гараже и отправился к себе. Мне не давала покоя эта история. Всю ночь я пересматривал запись нашего пути от и до с целью найти что-то необычное, найти какие-то подсказки. Примерно к четырём утра, когда солнце только готовилось вставать, я завёл свой байк и поехал к убранной на обочину гвоздевой доске. Находясь приблизительно в километре от пункта назначения, я увидел как там стоим трактор, а его водитель чем-то занят на краю дороги. Когда я подъехал, тракториста уже не было. Осмотр местности не дал абсолютно ничего интересного. В ста метрах обратного пути моё внимание привлекла притоптанная высокая трава. В конце этой тропы была перекопана земля площадью примерно 4х4 метра. Когда я оказался там мне стало жутко. Решил проверил самую худшую теорию. Я достал из байка сапёрскую лопату времён Второй мировой и начал копать. Копал не долго. Моя лопата воткнулась во что-то мягкое. Мои нервы начали сбоить, но я продолжал раскапывать. С каждым взмахом лопаты я ближе и ближе оказывался к тому, чего боялся. Это была какая-то ткань. Разгрёб землю в стороны и увидел ногу. Я побежал к байку. Поехал прямиком в полицию. Два года назад его осудили. Следствие доказало причастность тракториста к убийству людей на дороге, подстраиванию несчастных случаев и каннибализму.",

      "content": "This story happened in my childhood, I was around 8 years old at the time. I lived in a small country town in Brazil, it was a very peaceful life but it was wonderful for a child, I spent the day running around with my friends, playing various games and when it got close to 6pm it was time to go back home, take a shower and eat something and then later go to sleep for a bit. It had been a normal day for a child, my mother had made my favorite food that night, I ate a lot, I watched a little TV until my mother said it was time to sleep, I was tired and had been running back and forth all day. My mother put me to bed and said good night son and kissed me on the forehead, I answered her and went to sleep, the bed was so cozy that I fell asleep right away. That same night, after sleeping for a few hours, I woke up at dawn. Feeling strange, I couldn't say what it was but I had a strange sensation I tried to go back to sleep but I couldn't, that's when I stopped and started looking at the ceiling getting lost in my thoughts, when my peripheral vision He noticed something strange, behind my wardrobe there was something looking at me, his eyes were gray but somehow they shone in a way that was almost as if they had gone out, it was a half empty look, a bit disturbing, he was very tall and completely black only his eyes stood out even though they were almost turned off, he was dark like the night I froze when I noticed him there My body didn't want to move, I wanted to scream at my parents in desperation but nothing came out of my dry throat I swallowed the spit, it didn't move an inch it seemed like a nightmare after 1 minute of pure terror I managed to scream, my mother and father came running and asked what had happened I wanted to say what I saw but even I didn't believe it, imagine they will laugh at me So I said I had a nightmare mom, sorry for the scare, but can I sleep with you today? She hugged me and said come on, I went to their room that night, but I couldn't sleep thinking what the hell was that thing? (this is the beginning of the story depending on if anyone is interested I will finish it)",

      "content": "I deliver new born babies and I am use to it now as I have been doing it for 20 years. New born babies need to cry and they tend to have a tight grip as well. Well it was just like any other day and as I delivered a new born baby into the world, the baby gripped my finger. It had impressive strength for a baby and it's always cute when a baby does this. Then as I tried to take the babies grip off my finger, I couldn't get it off. I smirked for a bit and I was feeling rather embarrassed. The nurses were getting ready to end their shift and the mother was relieved that she had delivered a healthy baby. I just couldn't seem to free my finger from the babies grip. I even tried to use more strength and I just couldn't do it. I tried calling out for help but they just ignored me, and then when I called out for help again they all finally noticed me. They laughed at me for not being able to free myself from the grip of this new born baby, but it was truly strong. I had never felt such strength on a baby before. Then a nurse came over to help me free my finger from the babies grip, she also mocked me for not being able to do it myself. Then when the nurse tried to free my finger from the babies grip, she was surprised by how strong the baby was. She then looked at me with full understanding of my cries for help. Then more nurses tried to help my finger become free from the babies grip, and the mother started to worry now. She started to cry and shout at all of us at what we were doing. Then I was in the room with the baby still tightly holding my finger, and everyone else was trying to figure out how to free my finger from the babies grip. They tried using pliers and other tools to break the babies grip from my finger, but it was still no match. Then the babies grip got stronger and my finger started to hurt, and if the grip got anymore stronger it will seriously hurt me. Then my worries became real when the babies grip got stronger and it broke my finger and I shouted in pain. Then the only thing to do was to chop off my finger, and when they did, the baby still had its grips on my chopped off finger.",

      "content": "Mantis research inc. Marshal and Briana stood side by side on the cracked sidewalk of downtown, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows between the squat buildings. The street was a patchwork of neon flickers and fading signs: “Mad Mike’s Electronic Discounts” buzzed faintly to one side, while “Uncle Poe’s Chinese Supermarket” sat quietly on the other. Between them, a gray, squat building with two narrow doors stood oddly out of place. Above, a sign read Mantis Research Inc. They watched as people shuffled past—workers, or maybe just visitors—entering through one door and exiting from the other with a steady rhythm, like clockwork. No smiles, no chatter. Just movement. A silent procession. Marshal adjusted his designer jacket, smoothing down his expensive watch, impatience flickering across his face. “Looks... clinical,” he muttered. Briana’s eyes narrowed. “More like a trap.” The lobby inside was everything they expected: sterile, clinical, and unnervingly quiet. A lone receptionist sat behind a gleaming desk, her eyes just a little too wide, her posture too still. Rows of cheap chairs lined the walls, while behind her, a lift gleamed, polished and silent. A security guard stood by the door, nodding at them without expression. They were handed thick, densely worded disclaimers printed in tiny font. The receptionist asked for their bank details, explaining payment would be made immediately upon signature. Marshal barely glanced at the pages before signing, fingers twitching to move on. Briana, more cautious, scanned every line, hesitating. The subtle pressure of Marshal’s gaze finally won her over. The lift doors slid open with a whisper. They stepped inside. Their guide was a tall, slender figure, unnervingly graceful, with limbs too long and movements too smooth. Her hair was tied back tightly, but something beneath it—two faint ridges—hinted at something not quite human. Her eyes didn’t blink. A radio crackled with sharp clicks and chitters. Down they went. Research Notes: Subject M47 and F34 Report #11324 Subjects submitted to initial anatomical measurements. Subject M47 reacted calmly; Subject F34 displayed mild anxiety. Internal probes caused distress; mild sedatives administered with partial effect. Subject F34 became highly agitated when hair was forcibly removed. Restraints were applied following refusal to cooperate. Sedatives ineffective; subject remains anxious and uncommunicative. Report #11347 Behavioral analysis of subjects during neurological stimulation. Subject M47 displayed symptoms of cognitive dissonance post-procedure. Subject F34 remained withdrawn, showing resistance to stimuli. Research Notes: Subject M47 — Final Experiment Report #11400 Interbreeding procedure initiated. Subject F34 engaged in the process with apparent primal instinct. Subject M47 exhibited confusion and distress as neural pathways were compromised. Post-procedure observations revealed cephalic detachment. Subject M47’s secondary neural cluster exhibited autonomous activity consistent with species reproductive behavior. Subject status: terminated. Weeks later, a party at the local sorority house hummed with laughter and clinking glasses. The new pledge—Briana—moved through the crowd with a quiet confidence. “This year’s pledge really outdid herself,” whispered a sister, swirling her drink. “These cocktails… they’re sweeter than usual. I feel it already.” She smiled, eyes sparkling with just the right hint of intoxication. “When I wake up, I’ll tell her she’s in.”",

      "content": "A woman has managed to trick Leonardo dicaprio into thinking that she is 20 years old, when she is in fact 30 years old. Gloria has come to me in discreet and she wants to confess something to me. I recognised her from some where and I realised that she was the latest date interest with Leonardo Dicaprio. The tabloids says that she is 20 years old but she has confessed to me that she is actually 30 years old. She feels bad for tricking Leonardo into thinking that she is 20 years old, but she is doing it as she needs the fame and clout. I am a therapist by trade and I guess she does need some form of therapy. She told me that Leonardo has already asked about how she acts. Leo has said how she is very mature for a 20 year old and she tries her best to act like a 20 year old. She tries to stay active as a 30 year old and we all know that the brain fully develops at 25. She has confessed to me that she has been taking drugs to make her feel like a 20 year old. Leo hasn't guessed yet about the while truth. She stole the identity of a fellow model and she has been pretending to be her ever since. Leo has noticed how she is definitely maturer than the other women he has dated and that there is something odd with Gloria. Leo only dates women that are under 25 and she doesn't want to find out what leo would do to her if she told him the truth. I asked her about the real Gloria that she stole the identity of, and what she told me has truly frightened me. Desperation is a menacing disease and one which could turn a saint into a devil. She stole the identity of the real Gloria by doing a spell. Now the real Gloria is invisible and her identity has gone to this woman pretending to be her. The only way the real Gloria can regain her own identity is by killing this 30 year old woman, who is actually called Stephanie. Then a couple of my objects lunged at the fake Gloria and she dodges out of the way. The fake Gloria tells me that it is the real Gloria who is invisible now, who threw those objects at her. The real Gloria has tried to kill her many times. Then she went up and walked away.",

      "content": "I'm a music teacher in Denver. The most valuable things in my life were my trust and my sense of integrity, until I met Tyler. Tyler and I met at a local music store. He was a guitarist like me, and we became fast friends. Over the months we became close, going to music festivals, performing together, and even composing together on our days off. One day Tyler came to my door, his eyes red. He was in danger of being evicted because he couldn't pay his rent. His father was sick and he had to help with family expenses. He was already an extraordinarily talented musician, and I didn't think he was getting the chance he deserved. I gave him $800. It wasn't all my savings, but it was a significant amount. Two weeks later he came back. This time he needed $1,500 to pay for his father's surgery. I hesitated, but I said, \"Man, how can I say no to you?\" I took out my credit card and we withdrew the money. As the months passed, Tyler's financial needs increased. There was always a good reason. Car repairs, help for his family, music equipment. So I gave him my credit card and bank details so he could use it in case of emergencies. From time to time I would check my account activity and everything seemed reasonable. Until tax time. Tyler had withdrawn a total of $28,000 from my accounts and credit cards over a 15-month period. Most of the time, he started with small amounts and then gradually increased them. When I called him, he didn't answer his phone. When I went to his house, the landlord told me Tyler had moved out three months ago. One by one, his social media accounts, other people in his friend group, they all started disappearing. I finally went to the police, and the detective told me that Tyler's real name was actually James Wilson and that he had scammed people in at least seven different states using similar stories. He was known as “The Musician Scammer.” He would get into bands, look talented, gain trust, then disappear with people's money. My credit score is ruined. My savings were wiped out. Worst of all, when I want to make music, those memories come back. I even think twice about asking someone to borrow equipment. They never found Tyler. Sometimes I see a video of a guitarist performing in a bar and I wonder if it's him, with a new name, a new victim. And every time it breaks my heart, not just for my money, but because he stole a piece of my love for music. Check out more True Best Friend Horror Stories",

      "content": "Darryl adjusted his tie in the passenger-side mirror, Charlotte's frustrated sigh filling the quiet of the car. The dinner party had been a disaster. One too many glasses of wine, a passive-aggressive lecture from a smug dinner guest about \"realistic career paths,\" and now silence hung thick between the newlyweds. \"I just want something salty,\" Darryl muttered. \"And maybe something sweet.\" \"And I want a portal to another life,\" Charlotte replied dryly. As if summoned by sarcasm, a flickering neon sign appeared just beyond the bend: EZ Stop – Open Always. The gas station perched awkwardly at the edge of an unmarked service road, half-swallowed by encroaching woods and mist that didn't quite behave like it should. It hummed softly, almost... expectantly. Inside, fluorescent lights buzzed like whispering insects. The cashier looked up. She was impossibly thin, limbs long and unsettlingly fluid beneath a vintage band tee. Her fish-like eyes blinked out of sync, and faint scales shimmered at her throat where her shirt had slipped. She slowly forked a sardine from a tin, unbothered by their entrance. Zeke, the shelf-stocker, didn’t glance up from restocking crisps. A short, slightly burnt-smelling man with a backwards cap tugged low to hide the stubby horns peeking out. Tattoos danced across his arms, shifting when not watched directly. \"You’re late,\" he muttered to no one, slapping a pack of off-brand jerky onto the shelf. Charlotte peeled off toward the magazine rack, lips already curled in a knowing sneer. \"Oh great, pulp hell,\" she said aloud, only to stop. The rack didn’t hold the usual tabloids or cheap thrillers. Instead, it was stacked with classics—faded first editions from long-dead authors. She reached for a worn copy of The King in Yellow just as a man beside her huffed. \"They always shelve me next to Lovecraft,\" he sniffed. \"As though I didn’t invent half the ideas he plundered.\" Charlotte blinked. \"I—sorry?\" The man adjusted a battered hat. \"Ambrose Bierce. And no, you won’t find me on your university syllabus.\" Meanwhile, Darryl wandered aisles that seemed to twist and lengthen. He reached for a chocolate bar—only to feel it tug back. He blinked. The wrapper smiled. He recoiled. \"Need a hand, sugar?\" a velvety voice purred. He turned to see a woman in a vintage power suit, curves aged like brandy. Her once-beautiful face was faintly cracked porcelain, eyes glowing with residual glamour. She held a pack of breath mints and winked. \"Some of us still got it.\" Then the front door groaned open. A cowboy stepped in—boots hovering just above the floor. Dust followed him, though it hadn’t been a dusty day. He tipped his hat at the employees. \"Ain’t got a hitchin’ post, huh? Figures. Y’all got Bison Creek tobacco? And a shot of Widow Jane?\" \"We ran out in 1846,\" Marla deadpanned from behind the counter. Darryl gathered armfuls of snacks in polite haste. \"Let’s just pay and go.\" Charlotte held up the book. \"Where did that Bierce guy go? He took the one I wanted.\" The lights flickered. Zeke thumped the ceiling with a broom. \"If you’re gonna buy something, I’d do it soon.\" Darryl approached the counter and held out his card. Marla rolled her eyes. \"Sorry, hon. We don’t take that. Cash only.\" He hesitated. Charlotte hissed, \"Oh for goodness’ sake, Darryl. Just pay what they’re asking.\" Marla smiled slowly, her cold hand brushing his. His vision blurred for a moment. \"Payment accepted.\" Darryl blinked. The car’s engine purred. He was back on the road, headlights stretching into familiar darkness. He felt good. Better than he had in months. Lighter, even. But something… He glanced at the passenger seat. Empty. Something was missing. Or someone? His brow furrowed. He shook the thought away. Weeks later, Darryl laughed with coworkers at the water cooler. He whistled more. Ate better. Slept deeper. But every once in a while, when he passed a flickering neon sign or smelled something briny and metallic... He’d pause. There was something just at the edge of memory. A place. A girl with scales. A cold touch. But it was gone before he could reach it. And he felt— Happier, perhaps. But never quite",

      "content": "Forgiveness is a super power and it's hard to realise how much of a super power it is. Forgiveness on the outlook looks weak and cowardly but it takes immense strength to forgive someone. Like when I forgave the guy who murdered my wife and children, he begged me not to forgive him. He kept sending me letters and other messages to not forgive him. I found where he lives and I forgave him, the amount of energy and strength that it took to forgive him, it literally blew him up to pieces. I forgave him so much and I would do it again. Then when I was getting bullied at work, I gave more bullies more ammo to use against me and bully me more. When I forgave them for little things, it didn't kill them but it made them ill. So I gave them more things about me that they could bully me on. So my bullies bullied me on those things and they were grateful that I was giving them more ammo to bully me on. I did so many strange things in my private time, that they relished in bullying me. I was happy for them and I forgave them every time and every time they became more sicker. The more they bullied and did things to me, the more energy it took to forgive them and it went towards them and it harmed them. I kept giving my bullies more things about me to bully me on, but then eventually they didn't want to bully me anymore. It was just one guy now who was bullying me at work now, and when he pissed on the graced of my family, he begged me not to forgive him. I forgave him and it took so much energy to forgive him that it ripped his body. So many people are calling me an ass hole for forgiving them. I love forgiving people. Then when one of my prisoners that I had abducted and kept down in my prison cellar, they escaped. They managed to break the locks and I am sending them letters to never forgive me. I am begging them to never forgive me and they aren't saying anything to me or replying to me. If they forgive me then all that energy that it will take to forgive such a foul act of abduction, will completely destroy me. I hope they won't forgive me but I feel that they will.",

It's only if we are imprisoned or near to death till we realise that we want freedom. Freedom feels amazing when it's gets taken away and I felt that when I had to do a year in prison. I was scared at first but then when I actually got there, it wasnt that bad. Everyone else in prison was just like me that wanted to get out and live their life. I wanted my freedom back but prison gave me the time to rethink my life. Then I started to hear about a group of prisoners that had found a way out of prison, they were so excited. One day they found a weird looking hole in their cell, and it wasn't their before and the walls are hard, so theres no way that they could have just made a hole without causing immense noise for the guards to hear, but that hole was there now. Some of them felt something off with this hole but they all went through it. The sense and needof freedom was too much for them all. Then the screams came afterwards and the hole disappeared. For about 2 weeks we would hear their screams but they would be no where to be found in prison, until one day we found them in chunks of cut out meat. Then one day I woke up to find a random hole in m cells and I could smell freedom. Oh to do what one wants at whatever time of day and night is a privilege. That hole wasn't there before and I certainly didn't make and neither did my cell mate. I told a couple of guys and they were all excited to get out of prison. Then I reminded them about the last group of prisoners that went through the hole, and they all became scared. Then as days went past the hole tempted us with freedom and then they all went through it. I was about to go through it until I had a flash back of all the things I had done wrong in my life. I deserved to be in prison. So I stayed in my cell. Then the hole went during the night and we could hear the screams of those that went through. Then we found their bones in the kitchen and I guess freedom is the monster here.",

      "content": "PART-1 : A real paranormal incident happened to me which I myself cannot understand, mostly because it still sounds insane even to me. But the footage’s gone, the game’s gone, and… well, I just want to put this out there in case someone else saw what I did. This happened about a few weeks ago, in mid April. I’m a content creator—nothing huge, just under 80K subs. I mostly cover early access stuff, betas, modded gameplay, weird finds, and the occasional retro stream. I’m based in Calgary, working out of a cramped apartment that doubles as my studio. If you’re into weird builds or obscure game leaks, you’ve probably stumbled across one of my videos. Anyway, this story starts like most do in the indie gamer space: with a late-night DM, a shady link, and way too much curiosity. I wasn’t looking for trouble. I was just hoping to be first. First to cover something new, maybe even viral. And yeah, when someone says they’ve got a leaked internal build of GTA 6 running on a dev environment? You check it out. Especially when you’re desperate for content and views are dipping. At the time, it felt like a goldmine. Now… I wish I’d never touched it. Not because it was fake. Because it was too real. And somehow, in the middle of all that code and data, it saw something it shouldn’t have. I live alone in a small one-bedroom apartment just outside downtown Calgary. Nothing fancy—just a place that’s quiet enough to record in and has decent lighting for my setup. My PC desk takes up most of the living room wall, crammed between a shelf of unopened game boxes and a dusty blackout curtain I never quite got around to replacing. It’s functional, not pretty. But it works. My daily routine was pretty locked in—wake up around noon, scroll through Twitter and Reddit for gaming news, maybe stream if I had something new, and then spend most of the night editing or gaming. It’s not glamorous, but for a guy like me, chasing YouTube growth one thumbnail at a time, it was the dream. I didn’t go out much, but I kept in touch with a couple of friends from the streaming space—mostly through Discord. One of them, Jay, a horror streamer from Montreal, was usually my go-to when I needed a second pair of eyes on shady builds or weird indie files. We shared an unhealthy fascination with glitched-out content—especially stuff that felt a little… off. That week had been slow. No big launches, no drama. My last upload barely cracked 5K views. I was looking for something—anything—to get people talking. So when I got a random DM from a dead account with nothing but a download link and the words “don’t play alone”, it honestly felt like a gift. Jay thought it was probably bait or malware. I ran a scan—clean. He still told me to sandbox it, but I didn’t. I figured I’d record a cold launch, post a reaction clip, and maybe dig into the files later if it didn’t brick my system. Just another night, I thought. One more weird leak in a sea of fake ones. Looking back now, I wonder if I should’ve taken that message more seriously. I wonder if “don’t play alone” was a warning… or a rule. To be continued (check bio for 8D audio link )...",

      "title": "The Filaktov Project: The most disturbing Experiment from the URSS",
      "content": "During World War II, while the world focused on battles and borders, a hidden medical facility deep within the forests near Klin, 85 kilometers north of Moscow, operated in secret. Officially, it was a psychiatric sanatorium. But internally, it was known as the Filaktov Institute, named after its founder: doctor. Mikhail Filaktov, a neurologist obsessed with isolating the human soul. According to declassified KGB documents released in the 1990s, and mysteriously pulled from circulation shortly after, the Filaktov Project aimed to create a bodiless conscious state, a purely mental entity capable of surviving total physical trauma. The theory proposed that if a human could keep their consciousness alive without vital organs, they could be trained to spy, influence, or even possess others. Five political prisoners were selected, all men between 25 and 40 years old. They were promised freedom in exchange for their participation. Each subject was administered a mixture of psychoactive gases derived from LSD and scopolamine, combined with complete sensory deprivation in sealed tanks for fifteen consecutive days. These tanks were interconnected via audio systems, and every word was recorded. By day three, one of the subjects, identified only as Patient 3, began speaking in a dialect unknown to the research staff. It was not Russian, German, or Latin. Surviving audio, which later surfaced on a Bulgarian forum, features a voice alternating between moans, reversed guttural phrases, and childlike laughter that intensifies without warning. On day nine, one of the tanks was opened in response to a medical emergency. Sensors indicated the subject had no pulse. What they found defied medical logic: the man’s torso had been torn open from abdomen to sternum, as though clawed from the inside out. Yet as researchers attempted to remove the body, the subject gripped the steel doorway with unthinkable strength, opened his eyes, and said with a crooked smile, “Don’t wake me. I can still see God in here.” Despite multiple deaths, the experiment continued. One surviving subject stopped speaking, eating, and sleeping altogether. He was kept alive through intravenous fluids. During an observation, doctor. Filaktov approached too closely. The patient lunged and bit into the doctor’s face, ripping off part of his cheek. With blood running down his chin, the man swallowed the flesh whole without blinking and muttered, “Now you’ll know how I feel since they tore the meat from my soul.” The documents state that the final surviving patient was locked inside a lead-lined chamber where he writhed day and night, repeating a single phrase over and over again: “I am not alone. He already lives inside me.” Three weeks later, the facility was sealed following a fire. No one survived. doctor. Filaktov’s body was never recovered. In 1992, a group of urban explorers discovered the ruins of the building. In the basement, they found a walled-off room. After carving out a hole in the concrete, they saw a rusted bed, claw marks on the walls, and a single word scratched into the surface in dried blood, written in Old Russian: “Perezhit’.” It means “Survive.” Some believe the Filaktov Project is nothing more than an urban legend, a kind of Russian creepypasta born before the internet. Others are convinced it was real, citing evidence that Soviet scientists experimented with extreme psychology, telepathy, and sensory deprivation during the war. The case was archived, then erased from all public records. Curiously, when searching for doctor. Filaktov in official medical databases, his status is not listed as deceased. It simply reads: “Missing since 1942.”",

      "content": "Leaving Dartmouth was easy; the busy streets and the piles of garbage all around town weren't really what I was into. The moment I got onto the bus, I let out an audible sigh of relief; I was finally coming home. Nova Scotia is truly beautiful, the scenery as green as the ferns that lay upon the land. It really was an enjoyable first few hours, up until I noticed something was off about the people that rode on the bus with me. They were quiet, and I know people on public transportation are usually quiet, but I mean I hadn't heard one word spoken, one cough, sneeze, or even a breath. I thought this was weird but didn't think much of it until we made it to our first stop. The driver announced over the PA we could leave the bus for 15 minutes to stretch our legs. Excited to finally be able to stand up, I waited for the people in front of me to get up first before I left, but no one did. after a minute I got up and started walking down the aisle. Everyone had their eyes locked on me. Feeling uneasy but still not convinced anything weird was going on, I got off the bus, had a few cigarettes, and got back on. As I boarded the bus, everyone looked as though they had nodded off, yet there was no snoring. Odd, but not everyone snores, so I guessed the bus was just full of nose breathers. Sitting back in my seat, I looked up to see everyone was turning their heads away from me as if they were staring again. Seriously freaked out now, I planned on just getting off at my next stop and taking the next bus. Not 30 minutes into the drive, I noticed the bus taking an off-ramp, and then the fog came. As we drove down the road, it came rolling in like I've never seen. I couldn't even see a foot out of my window. That's when the bus stopped. Freaking out from all the previous events, I felt anxiety coming on strong. The lights flickered in the bus and then went out. It was pitch black. Checking the time on my phone, it read 2:45 am. Confused, as it's only been a few hours since I was on the bus and I left at 3 pm, all at once synchronized whispers filled my head: \"You're not supposed to be here.\" \"How did you get here?\" I felt hands grabbing at my body. I was flailing my arms and kicking my legs. Then I saw a face not 2 inches from my own. The eyes were hollow, and the mouth hung open from a jaw that had to be dislocated. Then the lights came on, and everyone was gone. I thought I just had a bad dream, but what happened to all the passengers? The bus driver, staring at me with a grin in the rearview mirror, announces on the radio, Next stop: Port Hawkesbury. It was the longest hour of my life. I just wanted off that bus. Arriving in Port Hawkesbury, I bolted off the bus and looked back... the bus was gone like it wasn't even there. I called my friend, who picked me up and drove me the rest of the way home. He was different, not speaking at all the whole way home and not saying goodbye as he dropped me off, just peeling away. I got a call from my friend asking where I was. Confused, I told him, \"You literally just dropped me off, and what was up with you not responding to me or making conversation at all?\" He responded with, \"Come on, stop messing with me. I'm outside of where you told me to pick you up. Hurry up; I have stuff to do in the morning.\" I told him I already made it home, and he got mad, saying if I had another way home, he didn't have to drive 2 hours to come get me, and hung up. Even more confused, I went inside, noticing my parents on the couch staring blankly into the TV. Not a word from them, no matter how much I tried. Freaking out, I ran to my room, shut and locked the door when I heard it again: \"You're not supposed to be here.\" \"Leave.\" The whispers stayed even with my hands covering my ears so hard it felt like I was going to crush my own skull. My parents called asking when I was going to arrive home. Not knowing what to say, I told them I got stuck in Port Hawkesbury and that I was going to stay the night there. I'm in my room right now writing this out. I can text my friends and call them, and the internet works as usual. I'm starting to think I'm stuck in some kind of alternative universe, and I don't have the slightest clue on how to leave. Please help me",

      "content": "After my pc got damaged from overuse and excessive gameplays, I called the technician who had already repaired my pc earlier also, but he said he was out of town for some reason. He gave me phone number of some other technician he knew and told me that he would call him too. He texted me after some time that he had called him and he would soon come to repair the pc. I thanked him and gone to the kitchen for some food. It was the next day. I completely forgot about all that and went for a bath. My doorbell rang and I was still in bathroom. I got my towel and gone to open the door. A guy who is age is same as me, wearing a blue uniform with a blue cap told me he was sent here. I remembered about that and had him in. He talked with me about reducing the excess usage and I offered him some coffee. He took two hours to fully fix the pc. After paying him, he said good bye and I was again on my pc. The pc become good again and was running smoothly. I played Valorant for sometime and then head back to my work. Searching my files, I found a unknown file named 'Brad.exe'. Brad is my name and I don't remember saving any file with my name. I didn't opened that file and called my technician. He didn't picked up his phone. I called the technician who came to my house. Upon dialing his number, it said incorrect number. I realised that I'm in a difficult situation now. I have seen many videos on internet telling not to open unknown files. So I tried to delete that file. I selected the file and pressed delete. But instead of deleting the file, it got opened. After opening, it shows a old, distorted video. Only play option was there. No other option worked. Even tried to turn off my pc. Surprisingly it turned off. I quickly tried to call the technician, but that didn't work. After an hour when I tried to turn on my pc, a music started playing. At first the sound of music was low. The loading was black and no booting animation was showing. The sound got louder second by second and the screen emitted a red light. The screen turned on and it was playing something. A old, distorted and disturbing video. Two boys are showing tieing a man with a rope to a pillar. The two boys had hammers with them. The music became as loud to be able to hear perfectly. It was a song by a woman but it's so distorted that I can't hear every words. Only the rhythm is some what hearable. The boys had finished tieing the man. They started to beat the man with hammer and breaking his joints. The scream of the man and the laughter of the boys cannot be heard because of the music, but I can see that in the video. I tried to turn off my pc as earlier but an small screen shown in the screen. The small screen said \"Is your pc fixed now\" while the video and music was playing in background. The music became so loud and video was extremely gore and violent, the boys were breaking every body part with the hammer and man was screaming and was full of blood. I tried to call both the technician but no one picked the call. Till then the music was so loud that I couldn't hear my own voice. I had no option other than destroying the pc. I picked my chair and started beating the pc. The video and music still playing while I'm breaking the pc. After completing breaking the pc, I got tired and got a call on my phone, it was from my regular technician. I told about all the incident but he told that he forgot to call the technician and the number he gave I didn't called it till now. Then who was the guy who repaired my pc? Thinking about that still gives me chills, but I didn't saw him after that day but I'm still living in the same apartment. Is he still watching me?",

He was my best friend for fifteen years. He died last winter. Or… I thought he did. Three weeks ago, I woke up to the sound of my front door creaking open. I live alone. I grabbed a bat from under the bed and crept into the hallway. That’s when I heard it. A voice, flat and synthetic, echoing from the kitchen. “Hello. I am a good boy.” It sounded exactly like Microsoft Sam. I froze. No footsteps. No movement. Just that monotone voice again. “I want. My ball.” I stepped into the kitchen, heart hammering—and there he was. Rufus. Same patchy fur. Same graying muzzle. Same old blue collar. But his eyes… they were wrong. Too human. Too aware. He was sitting perfectly still, mouth closed. The words were coming from inside him, but his lips never moved. “You buried me. But I remember everything.” I dropped the bat. He started following me around the house. Just sitting and staring. And every so often: “Where is the red ball.” “I am. Still. A good boy.” “You let them put me down.” I didn’t. He was suffering. I held him while the vet injected him. He licked my hand. I thought he was at peace. Last night, I woke up to him standing over my bed. “Fetch.” And then something wet and red hit the blanket. His favorite tennis ball. The same one we’d buried with him, now covered in blood. I haven’t left the house. I can’t. He won’t let me. “Play dead,” he says now, again and again, from the dark hallway. “It is. Your turn.”",

      "content": "It was the early spring of 1997. I remember my friend Victor had come to visit me (he lived on the other side of the state) because he wanted to confess something to me. I thought this would have been something normal, like he had accidentally broken something I had lent him. I was dead wrong, quite literally. Victor told me he had killed two people in November of the previous year (1996) and that he had every intention of continuing his spree. The last thing I would see alive was a revolver being shoved into my face and being shot. I woke up immediately as a ghost. I watched as Victor emptied the cylinder of the revolver into me. Six shots, all to the face/head. To add insult to injury, he kicked my dead body multiple times. He left my house satisfied that he had made me his third victim. I watched as no less than 24 hours after making me his third victim, he claimed his fourth. He did almost the same thing to him as he did to me. This victim was an average-height man with medium-length brown hair. Victor simply walked up to about 10-15 feet behind him, calmly pulled the revolver out, aimed at his back, and shot him six times. After he was certain he was dead, he walked up and kicked the man multiple times, then calmly walked away. I continued to watch Victor for four to five days. He was doing normal chores around the house, showing no remorse for killing the two people in November, me, or this other guy. Then one day, he walked out the door. I followed him as he drove to a house maybe two to three miles from his. He got out of the car, walked up to the front porch where an old man was, sitting asleep in a chair, then calmly pulled his revolver out, aimed it at the old man, and fired six shots. The old man never stood a chance. Now the fifth victim. One second he was sleeping in a chair on his front porch, the next second his house was surrounded by police cars, and he was in a morgue. The final victim I can confirm was killed by Victor was a young man who was about six feet tall, relatively skinny, and had medium-length blond hair. Victor calmly walked up behind him, pulled his gun out, and shot him six times. He then realized that he had just killed the man in broad daylight with hundreds of witnesses watching. So he quickly emptied the casings out of the cylinder and put in one bullet. He then pointed the gun at his own head and, like a coward, put a bullet through his own brain. Victor claimed six victims, not including himself, and I am still here, forever bound to this planet, wandering around aimlessly. As I drift through the shadows of my own demise, I can’t help but wonder if there are others like me, trapped in a limbo of despair, forever wandering the Earth.",

      "content": "Back in 2021, we started construction on our house in a desert area of an Arabic country. In Islam, we believe in something called jinn. They’re like spirits — creatures with their own world and powers. Some are harmless, others… not so much. We also believe in magic, especially black magic, which can be used to cause harm or manipulate people through jinn. The first night at the construction site was normal. Quiet. Empty. But starting from the third night, I began to feel something. A strange sensation that hit me every time I got near the house. It felt like I was being watched. Not just watched — studied. My skin would crawl the second I stepped close. At first, I tried to brush it off. In our culture, there's a belief that when a place is left abandoned for too long, jinn may claim it as their own. Or, if someone wishes harm upon you, they may send jinn to occupy it through black magic. On the fourth night, I began hearing sounds — soft, strange noises, like something moving through gravel or brushing past the walls. My cousin was with me, and I could tell he was uneasy too. We didn’t talk about it. By the fifth night, the noises became clearer. Whispers. Scratching. Movement that didn’t belong to any animal we knew. Then came the sixth night. That’s when I saw it — a figure, dark and fast, almost like a shadow running just out of reach. I only caught glimpses. But it was enough. We left for our home city shortly after. And honestly, I tried to forget. I buried it all. Life went back to normal for a while. But months later, we returned. One night while checking the place, we walked into the house — and there it was. A black snake, unmoving in the center of the floor. Its eyes were shiny and strange, and it stared directly at us. Not afraid. Not moving. Just watching. We called the elders. They brought a sheikh — someone who uses the Quran to break black magic. After visiting, he confirmed it: someone had cursed the house. Black magic had been placed on us. For several nights, the sheikh came and read verses until sunrise. It was intense. The air felt heavy. I still felt watched — even when I wasn’t near the house. Eventually, his work was done. The feeling faded. The house stood untouched for a while. Four years passed. We finished construction. We moved in. But the fear came rushing back. I couldn’t sleep. I didn’t feel safe. Every dark corner felt like it was hiding something. I made sure I was never alone, and that every shadowed place was locked tight. And still… Until this day, I haven’t told anyone about this. And I still refuse to go back to that house.",

      "content": "Appalachian Mountains, Tennessee – October 1837 The wind howled through the bare trees of the Cumberland Plateau, sweeping dry leaves across the moss-covered stones like whispers from the past. The settlement of Dagger Hollow—little more than a scattering of homesteads and a crumbling chapel—sat half-forgotten between two forested ridges, its people hardened by the mountains and haunted by something far older. Reverend Nathaniel Stone arrived just after sunset, walking up the narrow dirt path with a worn leather satchel slung over his shoulder and the heavy scent of woodsmoke in the air. The townsfolk were wary—tight-lipped and hollow-eyed—but they didn’t question his presence. They never did. Not when they saw the cross around his neck, or the quiet fire in his gaze. He was met at the chapel steps by the town’s sheriff, a broad-shouldered man with eyes like flint. “You the preacher from Lexington?” the sheriff asked, eyeing him. Stone shook his head. “No, not from Lexington. Just passin’ through.” The sheriff frowned. “We sent for a man of God. Something’s wrong here.” “I know,” Stone said. “That’s why I came.” Journal Entry – Mary Kincaid, age 17 October 14, 1837 The preacher came tonight. Tall, with a voice like thunder, but kind. Mama says not to trust him. Says no preacher should carry a scar on his hand shaped like a burning cross. But I saw the way he looked at the chapel—like he knew it was hiding something. Like he wasn’t afraid. They called it “the Hollow Curse.” Folks had begun vanishing—first an old hunter, then a child, then three more townsfolk, each gone without a trace. At night, people heard things in the trees: laughter like splintering wood, hoofbeats where no horses walked, and a whisper that chilled the soul. The chapel was the oldest building in town, built by the original settlers before the Revolution. Reverend Stone lingered inside long after the town had gone to sleep, tracing his fingers across the floorboards beneath the pulpit. He found it in minutes—a hatch, long sealed by prayer and dust, the iron ring etched with runes older than any English tongue. He opened it. The tunnel below descended into blackness, carved from rock and root, damp with the breath of something that should never have been disturbed. Stone walked into the dark without fear, one hand holding his Bible, the other clutching a lantern lit not with oil, but with fire he called down in a whispered prayer. Deep beneath the chapel lay a sanctum of the Unbound, a forgotten cult who’d once made blood offerings to a being they called Gor’shihel, the Pale Shepherd. The thing had been bound in 1712 by a preacher from the Carolina colonies—Reverend Stone, though he wore another name then. But something had weakened the seal. Perhaps time. Perhaps sin. Or perhaps the call of a frightened town had drawn Stone back to finish what had never truly been undone. The creature rose from a pit of bone and ash. It had no face, only a veil of stitched skin that twitched with each movement. Antlers curled from its head, black as rot. Its limbs were too long, its spine too sharp, and when it spoke, it was in the voices of those it had taken. “You return, O shepherd of light,” it hissed. “You cannot banish me again. I grow stronger with each age.” Reverend Stone stepped forward, undeterred. “In every age, I return,” he said. “And in every age, you fall.” The Pale Shepherd screamed, a sound like a thousand animals dying in reverse. Shadows boiled from the walls, claws reaching, maws snapping. Stone stood his ground, reciting scripture not written in any Bible—words that burned through the veil between worlds. The shadows shrieked and evaporated. The creature lunged, but Stone met it with a roar of divine fire, his Bible glowing in his hand. He pressed the holy book against the creature’s chest and drove it back into the pit, sealing it with a prayer that shook the mountain. When the tunnel collapsed behind him, the ashes of the Hollow settled once more. Journal Entry – Mary Kincaid October 16, 1837 The preacher’s gone. Didn’t say goodbye. Just left his satchel on the chapel steps. Inside it was a folded note: “You’ll be safe now. Keep the light.” Mama cried when she read it. Said she remembered a preacher who saved her grandfather from a witch-thing in Georgia, back in ‘93. He was young then, but the same eyes. Years later, when the chapel burned in a lightning storm, they found one thing untouched by flame: a wooden cross, charred black, but unbroken. And in the wild places where the veil thins, the legend of the preacher lingers. A man with no age, no home, and no fear of the dark. Because the dark fears him.",

      "title": "Where Rabbits Eat",
      "content": "They say there is a forgotten field, hidden among dead trees and pools of stagnant water, where rabbits eat. But what they eat… isn't what you think. It all started when three teenagers decided to record a video for their YouTube channel. They wanted to go viral by exploring urban legends in the region. The challenge was simple: spend the night at Campo dos Coelhos. They arrived there around 11pm. The place smelled of rotting flesh, mixed with wet earth. But what caught our attention was the number of holes in the ground. Not den holes… they were shallow graves, too small for us, but too big for any normal animal. The rabbits started to appear. Hundreds. All white, but with red spots in the mouth. The eyes? Yellowish, full of pus, and some hung out of their sockets. One of them approached, carrying something in his mouth. A human finger. The bravest of the group, Lucas, went to the largest hole and put his hand inside. When he pulled it… he came out with a piece of scalp stuck between his fingers. There were strands of blonde hair still stuck together. Before they could run, the ground began to shake. The rabbits gathered around them, forming a circle, and began to make grotesque sounds — a mixture of childish laughter and the grunt of a dying animal. The floor opened up. From inside, something came out. It was a pile of rotting flesh, with human eyes all over it, sewn into the body, and gaping holes where human voices whispered over and over. It had rabbit paws, but its face… it was a mosaic of overlapping human faces, like a quilt made of people. The eyes blinked in despair. The mouths screamed without sound. The creature approached the teenagers, who tried to run, but their legs sank into the fetid mud, and then the rabbits began to attack. But they didn't bite the meat. They ripped out their nails, devoured their eyes, and stuck their little paws into their mouths, until they ripped their throats out from the inside. The last to die was Lucas. Before being pulled underground, he looked at the camera. His eyes were gouged out while they were still blinking. They say that since that night the camp has become quieter, but if you go there at midnight you can hear a video playing over and over again in the darkness. And if you look closely, you'll see rabbits devouring their bodies. But not only that. The rabbits open the victims' bellies, remove the organs and plant black seeds inside. Because there, where the rabbits eat, they are growing people. People to eat again. Never go there. Never.",

      "content": "There was once a girl who walked through the forest every day and every night, that was the only thing she enjoyed. As a little kid, she was abused and would often go to the forest to calm down. When she turned 18, she found a cheap little apartment and moved in, far away from her childhood home. She thought she would be safe from her trauma there, but she was wrong. She wanted to find a place similar to the forest. She settled for the lake far from the city, an hour away. She would go there often, every weekend or so. At first, the lake was peaceful. birds chirping, water still, trees swaying gently in the wind. It was quiet. Too quiet. Over time, she began to feel watched. Not by animals or people... but by the lake itself. She would catch glimpses of figures standing knee-deep in the water. Pale, still, unmoving. Their faces didn’t look real, they were too smooth, too blank, like masks made of wet paper. But when she’d blink, they’d vanish. She told herself it was stress. Sleep deprivation. Maybe even a breakdown. But the lake kept calling. One night in mid-autumn, she drove to the lake in the dark. No moon, no stars. Just fog and silence. She didn’t bring her phone. She didn’t tell anyone. She just... needed peace. One last time. She sat by the shore, shoes off, toes dipped in the icy black water. She whispered things about the pain, the loneliness, how the world didn’t want her. And the lake... whispered back. It was a ripple at first. Then a voice, like many voices overlapping, speaking just beneath the surface. “Come in.” She stood. Walked into the water, slowly. The cold bit into her, but she didn’t care. She kept walking until the water reached her chest. Then she saw them. They rose silently from the lake, their heads just above the water, surrounding her. Dozens of them. Their eyes were wide and hollow. Their mouths stretched into frozen smiles. They didn’t pull her under. Not yet. They tore her open first. One drove its hand through her abdomen like it was wet paper. She screamed, but the water drowned it. Another gripped her face and dug sharp fingers into her cheeks, peeling the skin back with a sickening rip. They clawed at her, slicing through muscle and cracking bone, pulling her apart piece by piece as she thrashed and gurgled, blood blooming around her like red smoke. Her lungs filled with water. Her screams became bubbles. Her eyes burst from the pressure. But she was still aware. Still conscious as they dragged what was left of her down. The next morning, there was no sign of her. No clothes, no footsteps, no car. Just the still lake, quiet and calm as always. Two weeks later, a boy showed up at the lake. He said he just wanted to escape for a while. Said the city was too loud, that people didn’t understand him. That this place felt... peaceful. Familiar. He sat by the shore for hours, just staring at the water. As the sun dipped low, a pale hand slowly reached out from the shallows and dropped something at his feet. It was a jawbone, small, cracked, with bits of skin still hanging from it. The boy stared at it. Then looked up. All around the lake, they stood in the water again. Dozens of them. Eyes like rotten pearls. Mouths torn into unnatural smiles. One of them... was her. Half a face left, bloated and split, still smiling. The lake had chosen someone new. And it was hungry.",

      "content": "I'm Alex, I work for a software company in Philadelphia. I'm 35 years old and for the last five years my life has been going well. Until Ryan knocked on my door. Ryan and I were very close in high school, the ultimate rebellious duo. We would skip classes, commit petty thefts, occasionally steal cars for cheap thrills and leave the owner unharmed. Ryan had a brilliant mind, but he always took shortcuts. When I decided to go to college, he went deeper and deeper into the world of crime. When I was 20, I almost got arrested in an incident involving Ryan. That night I helped my friend borrow his car. Ryan was drunk and crashed it. I wasn't there, but my fingerprints were all over the car. Ryan was caught by the police, but for some reason he never gave my name. I changed my life after that. I finished college, got a good job in tech, got married and had a child. I cut all contact with Ryan, we weren't even friends on social media. After 15 years, one day there was a knock on my door. I opened it to find Ryan, looking older, more tired, but with the same sly smile. \"It's been a long time, man,\" he said, as if we had just met yesterday. I invited him in because my wife and child were at my in-laws for a weekend visit. Ryan told me what he'd been up to for the last 15 years. Three years in prison, failed marriages, temporary jobs. Then he got to the point: \"I'm here to offer you a job.\" I had no trouble guessing that his offer was a fraudulent scheme. He wanted me to use my access to our company's payment system. \"I understand,\" he said in a calm voice. \"But you know, the statute of limitations hasn't expired on that car theft case. And I have proof that you were there that night.\" I froze. \"That case is closed, Ryan. I wasn't there.\" \"I kept the screenshots of the texts on your phone, your fingerprints from the car, and all the statements you took from me. And remember the drugs we stole from a pharmacy that summer? I have documentation on that, too.\" I felt sick to my stomach. My wife knew very little about my past. My employers knew nothing. \"What do you want?\" I asked. \"A small back door into the company's system. Just some information. No one gets hurt,\" he said, smiling. I kicked Ryan out of my house that night, but his messages continued. I went to my company's security department and told them everything. My youthful mistakes, Ryan's blackmail, everything. I risked losing my job, but honesty was the only way out. My company understood. We cooperated with the police and had Ryan arrested for attempted blackmail. But I will never forget the fear and shame I felt during those terrible few weeks. Even your closest friends can sometimes weaponize your past mistakes. True friendship is based on mutual growth, not on exploiting each other's weak moments. Check out more True Best Friend Horror Stories",

      "content": "Anyone who is a fan of me, unlike me now. Go away and you lot only feed my ailment. I remember as a child I was forced to get a tattoo and I said to my father whether getting a tattoo was supposed to hurt? My father said that it was supposed to hurt. He said that everyone should go through some sort of abuse, so that they don't turn out spoiled. My father hated people that never went through any kind of abuse. So I was 10 years old when I got my first tattoo and I kept asking my father whether it was supposed to hurt? My father got so annoyed at me for asking the same question. Then he told me that tattoos were supposed to hurt and that our pain fed the turoko creature who lived in my father's tattoo shop. The creature fed off the pain that you feel when getting a tattoo. So my dad cared more about feeding this creature pain, so he started giving me a tattoo at the age of 10. This creature ate my pain like a sandwich and it felt good to him. My father was a tattoo artist and a make up artist as well. In the present day I am just telling people to stop being my fan and I want them to leave my social media. Fuck off to all my fans and when new fans came onto my social media, I would tell them to fuck off. When people would try to say hello to me on the streets, I would tell them to fuck off and to unfollow me everywhere. Everyday on all of my social media handles I tell everyone to fuck off and unlike me, and to unfollow me and I do my hardest I truly do. I remember once when my father was hard at working giving me another tattoo, it was painful. Then he gave my mother more make up and she was crying. All he cared was to feed the creature pain. Then one day as an adult, my friend took me to a tattoo artist. I was confused about how this tattoo artist gave tattoos? He did it differently from my father because my father used a knife to give tattoos. Then this tattooists wife also did make up on people but did it differently from my father, my father gave make up to my mother through punches and bruises. This revelation tore me and these weren't tattoos on my body but scars. I then became famous when people heard my story. Then I found when people were a fan of my life story and scars, the worship of these scars on my body still fed the creature. So please stop being my fan and unfollow me on everything and everywhere.",

It took a lot of bravery to go up to yulan and demand that he prove that he is dead. Yulan has been enjoying life ever since he started to tell people that he is dead and I demand proof. People like me are always going to ruin the party and that is my purpose I guess. You can't just go round telling people that you are dead. So yulan decided to take up my challenge and prove to everyone that he is dead. He started to dig around everywhere trying to find his body, and everyone was expecting the big proof that will confirm that he is dead. Yulan really hated my guts and I don't enjoy being that guy, but guys like me are needed to bring balance to everything. Yulan started to become an other worldly figure when he pronounced that he was dead, people would want to touch him and talk to him, because it felt like they were talking to the other side of existence. So yulan was digging around everywhere trying to find his body, and he needed a body to prove to everyone that he was dead. Then when he started to shout out loud that he had found his body, he carried it all around the area. He was so proud that he had found his body and he was showing it off to everyone. He was preaching that he was dead and that he had definitive proof that he was dead. Then when expected the body, I could sense the tenseness from yulan. This body did not belong to yulan and did no look like him. Then yulan shouted out loud \"look here is proof that I am dead as I don't heal from cuts and look upon my life and see how miserable it is. This horrid job and mundane existence!\" And as I tried to stop yulan from causing another scene, he kept shouting that he us dead. Some of the crowd believed him while others were on the fence. Then later that night as I was walking alone, I was attacked by yulan. Now he is carrying my body as his proof that he is dead. He is telling everyone \"my body was trying to sway people from believing that I am dead. Look here is my dead body\" and while in fact it isn't his dead body.",

I was the only one who managed to immigrate to England, and ever since then I have been working to support my own family and my siblings and their children in Bangladesh. I have two siblings in Bangladesh and they each have 2 kids, they never had to work in Bangladesh as I have been giving them money. This has always given me arguments with my wife and then eventually my children. I have built a huge house for my siblings and their children in Bangladesh, while my family live in a small 2 bed house. Yes I gave lots of money to Bangladesh but I felt the need to help my siblings and their children, as Bangladesh is a 3rd world country. Then when I started to reduce the amount of money I gave to Bangladesh, my siblings were incredibly ungrateful and said some things about me. Out of all the things I have done for them, this is how they react. So then I decided to stop giving money to them outright, and I even decided not to bring their children over to England. After a couple of months my siblings were begging me to give them some money and that they were struggling, but I was strong on my word of never giving them money anymore. As time went on they started to beg even more and they said how they had to start selling some stuff. My 3 nephews got into drugs and eventually killed, and my niece hung her self due to the immense poverty, but I stayed on course with my intentions. My siblings were angry with me because their children were no longer existing. Then my siblings started to get weird by saying \"we use to dance with our children while they were alive but now we dance with them while they are dead\" and this made no sense. Then my siblings started complaining to me about how their dead children aren't decomposing, and then they set their dead bodies on fire. Over the fire burning over their children's bodies they cooked chicken over the fire, chicken which they had stole. When they cooked chicken over the fire burning on my eldest nephew, the chicken tasted good and so that means he was a good person. When they cooked chicken burning over my second eldest nephew, it tasted bad and that means he was always bad. When they cooked chicken burning over my 3rd eldest nephew it tasted okay, that's mean he was neither bad or good. When they cooked chicken over the fire burning on my niece, it tasted horrid and that means that she was horrid. After many months, my 2 siblings were just begging me to support them and the new child they had made together. I was disgusted. Then on a video call, I saw my brother kill my sister and their child. Everyone was dead on Bangladesh, but how come I still get calls from all of them begging for money.",

      "content": "In the shadowy, pine-filled countryside of Greece, there’s an old legend known to the older locals but half forgotten and unknown to the few young people living there. The legend centres around an eerie stone statue of a little girl named Magda, hidden deep in the local dark pine forest. Magda was the daughter of a wealthy merchant in the late 1800s, a girl with straw-colored hair and a bright, innocent smile. She loved to play with her friends in the forest, especially a peculiar game of their own invention that was a blend of hide-and-seek and statues. The rules were simple: the children would blindfold themselves, and one person would stand by a tree in the distance, reciting a playful song while the others—blindfolded and stumbling—tried to reach them. The trick was that they could only move while the song was being sung. If the seeker caught them moving when the song stopped, the person who moved lost and was out of the game. The song is said to have gone like this: “Come here to this pine tree, While I am not looking, But as I turn ’round to you, Like statues you must be unmoving,” (repeated three times) On that fateful day, as golden sunlight filtered through the canopy, Magda and her friends delved deeper into the woods than ever before. The song of the game echoed through the trees as Magda, giggling beneath her blindfold, stumbled forward. But fate had something darker in store. She tripped, her foot caught on an exposed root, her head striking a jagged rock, leaving her motionless on the forest floor. Her friends stood frozen, uncertain what had happened. They approached cautiously, only to find Magda lying in a pool of her own blood, pale as a white sheet. Panic-stricken, convinced she was dead, the children ran. They left her there, alone, bleeding out in the stillness of the forest, too afraid to tell anyone what had happened. Magda’s body was found the next morning, her little fingers were curled into the dirt as if she had tried to crawl to safety. She hadn’t died instantly. She had lain there, cold and bleeding, waiting for someone to help her. No one ever did. Her grieving parents, shattered by the loss, built a stone statue of their beloved Magda on the very spot where she had died. Some say they even buried her body beneath the stone figure, eternally marking the place of her tragic death. The statue now stands old and weathered, its surface cracked and worn. Dry vines snake through the crevices, depicting her wearing the blindfold, her hands outstretched as if forever reaching for the seeker or the help she never found. But death, it seems, was not the end of Magda’s story. Locals whisper that if you venture deep into the forest and dare to find Magda’s statue, you can play her game once more. The legend says that Magda’s spirit, though unseen, will join you in the game. Those who play fairly and finish the game are said to be blessed with extraordinary luck, as if rewarded by Magda for keeping her memory alive. Some even claim you can hear her faint, childlike giggles drifting through the trees as you stumble blindly through the forest. But beware—the rules must be followed. If you start the game, it must be finished. If you cheat, leave before the game is over, or break any of the rules, you will suffer her wrath. It is said that those who break the rules leave the forest haunted and cursed forever, as if the little girl who died tragically has found a way to cling to them, her fury as strong as her desire to play. No one knows how many have tried to play the game and failed, but those who have come back speak of nightmares, eerie coincidences, and misfortune. But if you ever find yourself in that ancient Greek forest and stumble upon a weather-worn statue of a little girl, frozen in time—remember her story. And ask yourself: are you willing to play?",

      "content": "Report found in a hidden deep web group – Signed only as “D. M.” I read the rules. I memorized every line. I was prepared. I wanted my father back. He disappeared when I was eight years old. There was never a body. There was never mourning. Just absence. Then I discovered the Door Game. I waited for the right time. I chose a bathroom without a mirror — or at least I thought I did. The apartment was old, the walls were moldy. The bathtub still worked. I locked all the doors. I drew the triangle. I started the timer. I knocked. I whispered. Sixty-six times, counting each one accurately. When the timer reached 7 seconds, I crashed. I got lost in a second of hesitation. One second. The water turned red. I panicked, but continued. I followed the instructions in rule 12b: “The dealer got bored.” But I knew that wasn't it. I had angered him. And that's when I saw it: a forgotten mirror behind the door. Covered by an old cloth. I forgot rule 2. I forgot rule 12e. I tried to get out, but the doorknob melted in my hand. The lights flickered. The mirror began to ooze something... thick, black. It wasn't a reflection, it was an eye. He saw me. His voice came from inside the bathtub: \"You brought a mirror. You brought a portal.\" The wall where the mirror was folded inward, like flesh being pushed. And the Dealer emerged, but not as a person. It was made of doors. Wooden, iron, glass doors. All locked inside, but full of eyes on the outside. Each eye blinked with my fear. I tried to recite the verse to ask for forgiveness. But the voice didn't come out. He approached, eyes crackling like dry wood. \"Your father doesn't want to come back. But I can take you to him.\" The bathtub filled with a thick black substance. It stank of fermented meat. A hand—my own hand—came out of the water and grabbed my ankle. I screamed. It didn't help. I'm writing this from the other side. I don't know where I am. All I know is that I'm stuck on the wrong side of the door. There is no time here. No knocks. Just the constant sound of dripping water... and tapping from the mirror. If anyone reads this, destroy all the mirrors in the house before starting the ritual. Or the Dealer will pass through them. And he doesn't always come back alone.",

      "content": "Audio transcript recovered from a cell phone found inside a sealed wall. Date unknown. Voice identified as belonging to “L. B.” Sound of panting breathing. A metallic click. Something dragging in the background. \"Is it recording? It's... it's recording. I followed every rule. Every single one. Every door was locked. EVERYONE! Except... except that damn back door.\" \"The lock... rusty. I thought it was firm, I thought it held. The timer ran, I knocked sixty-six times. I did everything as told. But I didn't... I didn't lock the last lock.\" Muffled sound of creaking wood. Incomprehensible Latin whispers. “When I got to the part where I hit the Bible in the bathtub, the candles didn't go out. Then I knew. He was late. I started sweating. I did as the rule said: seven more knocks. No shouting. No invoking. And he... he came.” “But something was wrong. He... he had no face. Just a hole. A black hole that pulled in sound, light... and time. He stood still. The air froze. And I heard the click of the back door. The lock... gave way.” “The Dealer turned his face to me... and laughed. It wasn't with sound. It was with pain. My skin crawled, my mind snapped. And I understood: I didn't lock the last door. I let him in.” Screams in the background. Wet sounds, like flesh being wrung out. Glass shattering. “Now he doesn't just want my request. He wants my body. He wants my house. I'm locked inside the bathroom, but he's outside, repeating the knocks.” A dry beat. Then another. Up to seven. “Don't respond. If you hear the knocking... don't respond. He doesn't need the ritual anymore. He's already entered.” Sound of a latch breaking. The recording ends abruptly with a low, continuous scream. Note from the anonymous digital investigator who recovered the audio: \"This is the fifth case with the same structure. In each case, there is an overlooked lock. The pattern is clear: the Dealer only needs a single flaw to break through.\"",

      "title": "There’s Someone Living in the Vents",
      "content": "I live alone in a third-floor apartment of a small, older building. Rent’s decent, the landlord’s chill, and the walls are thick enough that I never hear my neighbors. It was the quiet that made me notice something was off. About two months ago, I started hearing a soft noise at night — a kind of scraping or shifting. I thought it was just old pipes or maybe a squirrel in the vents. My unit has one long vent that runs along the living room ceiling. I checked it during the day. Nothing. Then things started going missing. It began with small stuff: a spoon, one of my socks, a USB drive. I figured I was just being clumsy. But then a hoodie vanished, and a full sandwich I’d wrapped in foil disappeared from my fridge. The fridge! I live alone. I don’t have guests. I don’t drink or black out. There was no one else it could’ve been. So I set up a cheap motion camera in the living room, pointed it toward the kitchen and the hallway. I didn’t expect anything. But when I checked the footage the next morning, I froze. At 2:17 AM, someone climbed out of the ceiling vent. They moved slowly, carefully, like they’d done it before. They dropped down onto the couch without making a sound and crept to the kitchen. They were thin, barefoot, wearing a tattered hoodie — mine. They opened my fridge, took something, then walked to the hallway… and stood outside my bedroom door. Just stood there. For 11 minutes. Then they turned, climbed back up into the vent, and disappeared. I watched that clip over and over. It wasn’t a ghost. It wasn’t some visual glitch. It was a real person. Someone had been living in my ceiling. I called the police. They searched the vents and found signs that someone had been crawling through them: handprints, smudges, pieces of cloth used as bedding. But no person. They didn’t find anyone. The officers said it might’ve been a transient, someone who slipped in through the attic from another unit. They offered to file a report but couldn’t do much else. I changed my locks and nailed a wooden board over the vent opening. I didn’t sleep well for weeks. Eventually, things went quiet again. Nothing went missing. No weird noises. I tried to convince myself it was over. Then, last week, I noticed the board over the vent had shifted. Just slightly. The nails weren’t as tight as they had been. One was bent. I checked the camera. The footage had been deleted. Not corrupted — deleted. The only way that could’ve happened is if someone accessed the camera directly. I bought a ladder the next day and opened the vent during daylight, flashlight in hand. There was space. A lot more space than I expected. Enough for someone to move around. I crawled in a few feet and found a crumpled blanket, an empty water bottle, and wrappers from granola bars I never bought. Someone had been living up there for a long time. But what scared me more than the trash was the notebook. It was tucked in the blanket, and inside were dozens of pages of messy handwriting. The first few pages were lists of my belongings. Then there were entries like: “He’s home late tonight.” “He likes grape soda.” “Don’t go in when the blue light’s on.” The last page was dated two days ago. It read: “He knows.” “Find new place soon.” I burned the notebook and didn’t tell anyone. Not even the landlord. I didn’t want to deal with more cops, and I couldn’t afford to move again. So I reinforced the vent cover with steel brackets, sealed the edges, and set up a new camera — this time hidden. Nothing’s happened for five nights now. But tonight, I came home and saw muddy fingerprints on my bedroom window… from the inside. And one sentence written into the condensation on the glass: “You sealed the wrong vent.”",

      "content": "Narrated by: Elias Moura – 12 days after the first ritual The first time it worked. I don't know how to explain it... but it worked. I buried my younger brother in January. A car accident. Locked in the coffin, without a chance to say goodbye. And then, a friend told me about the Door Game. I did everything as ordered. I waited 3am. I locked everything. I drew the triangle with the candles. I knocked 66 times. The water turned blue. The next day, my brother's cell phone rang on my nightstand. And there was a message: “It still hurts, but I’m here.” After that, I went crazy. I wanted more. I wanted to see him. Talk to him. Touch it. So I did the ritual again. Rule 16: “DO NOT complete this ritual again.” I disrespected. And the dealer came back, yes. But not like before. It started with a smell. Blood and burnt wood. Then the beats. Alone. I heard the bathroom door being slammed from the inside, every morning, at 3:33 am. And the voice... \"You ordered wrong. You ordered too much.\" On the third night, the water in the bathtub was full again. I swear I didn't fill it. And it wasn't white or red. She was black. Dense. As I reached in, something tugged at my wrist. It wasn't a hand. It was a mouth. With human teeth. I cut my arm. I left staggering. I called the police. When they came back, there was nothing. No candles. No sign of the ritual. Just the water... blue again. And on the mirror, written in blood: \"You lost twice. Now you will pay for three.\" The following week, I buried my mother. Brain stroke. Two days later, my house caught fire with my dog ​​inside. Today is my last night. The bathtub is calling me. The dealer does not forgive anyone who insists. He doesn't need to. He judges. And when he judges... he charges. If anyone is reading this, don't play. Don't repeat. And for the love of everything that breathes… never make a wish for love. The dealer hates love.",

Before being transferred to room 313. The patient, Lucas H., arrived in a catatonic state. The family died a few days ago in a fire. His file only said that they tried to revive him after drowning, but were unsuccessful. He woke up alone three days later and said nothing. I just wrote. And what he wrote... didn't make any sense. “LockYourDoors.” \"The beats were 66. He lied. The water was red.\" “The bathtub still breathes.” The doctor thought it was traumatic delirium. I thought so too. Until the first night on duty. It was 2:52 am when I heard the sound. A... splash? As if something big fell into the water. But his bathroom had no water. I went to check. The door was open. Lucas, sitting on the bed, stared intently inside. The bathtub is dry, empty. But the floor... the floor was wet. And what made me stop, freeze right there, was the smell. It wasn't just humidity. It was rotten meat. As if something was being kept alive and dead at the same time. On the tile, near the bathtub, I noticed marks. With the light from my cell phone, I got closer and understood: finger marks. Like hands trying to get out of the ground. Ten fingers. Then ten more. Then dozens, one on top of the other. All fused into the grout, as if someone had pushed their fingers to the bone, scratching the tile to escape. I ran back to his bed. And he stared at me. \"He won't let me leave. But he can take you in my place.\" The light blinked. The candles that were on the bedside table – I swear I didn't put them there – lit themselves. They formed a triangle. I looked into the bathroom. The bathtub was now full. White water. And when I turned to run, the door was locked. I knocked. I screamed. I cried. Lucas stood up. \"You'll feel the hands too. They call, on the tile. Don't scream when the first one goes down your throat. He hates screaming.\" The last thing I remember was the sound of banging. Seven. And the water turning... red.",

      "content": "I work for an advertising company in Boston. The biggest mistake of my life was thinking that a person could be trusted unconditionally. Jessica and I met in college. We were both communication majors, living in the same dormitory. Over time, we became each other's closest confidants. I told her every detail of my life: my family problems, the most intimate details about my relationships, my career concerns, my embarrassing memories... Everything. Even after graduation, we remained friends. In fact, I found my current job on Jessica's recommendation. She had her own circle of friends in our office, and I gradually became part of that group. But I always felt like an outsider among them. At meetings or company dinners, sometimes people would laugh in my presence, then suddenly stop and look away. One day, after the office party, my colleague Alex and I were alone in the elevator. Alex was a little drunk and said to me: \"You know, I'm so sorry about your divorce last year. Jessica told me about the moment when you found out you were pregnant after your husband cheated on you. What a horrible experience,\" he said. And I froze. Yes, I was divorced and yes, my husband had cheated on me. I was pregnant and I had lost the baby because of all the stress. But I had only told Jessica this information. I hadn't told anyone else, not even my family. \"Did Jessica tell you this?\" I asked, shaking. \"Ah...\" said Alex, suddenly sober. \"I... I think I messed something up.\" That evening, I started rummaging through Jessica's Instagram account, and it didn't take me long to find her private message group, a group called \"Rachel's Dramas\". I discovered that I could log into the account using her phone number; she must have saved my password when she borrowed my phone in the past. For five years, Jessica had been feeding my life into the group like a live reality show. My divorce, my father's cancer diagnosis, my depression medication, even the embarrassing texts I sent to my ex-boyfriend after one night of drinking too much... Everything was there. People were laughing at my pain. When I confronted Jessica about it, she coldly said, \"Everyone already knows what a messy life you have, Rachel. I did everything I could to protect your reputation.\" Wherever I went, I saw the same look in people's eyes, pity and secret amusement. Worst of all, after Jessica I couldn't trust anyone. I can't tell anyone my true feelings anymore, except my therapist. And sometimes I am even skeptical of her. The most painful lesson I learned: Sometimes the person who seems to be your closest friend is your most dangerous enemy. Because they know exactly where to hit you.

Inside: a pillowcase. Old. Yellowed. Cut-out eyeholes. Across the front in red, those letters: IJLTK. Inside, always one word: “Sorry.” No one agrees on what the letters stand for. Some say it’s Latin. Others say it’s a kill list. All anyone knows is: when you start seeing them tagged in your town, it means the mask is close. It starts small. One tag on a wall. Then another — under a highway, behind a diner, scratched into a mirror in a public bathroom. Always fresh. Always red. That’s the signal. He’s nearby. Someone has the mask. And someone’s about to die. People say you never see the killer. But that’s not true. He wants you to see the tag. He wants you to panic. To wonder. To ask questions. To feel it creeping in — the gut twist, the paranoia. Because by the time you figure out what IJLTK really means… you’ve already been chosen. And here’s the part no one wants to admit: It’s not the mask that’s dangerous. It’s the person who asked for it. Whoever they were — they knew what the letters meant. They knew what it would make them do. And they still wanted it. There’s no possession. No curse. Just people. People with a rot already inside them. The mask just gives them permission. And when they’re done? The box shows up somewhere new. So if you start seeing the letters… If you notice them more often… If they show up on your block, or your school, or your front door— It means someone nearby is wearing the mask. And they’ve already picked you",

      "content": "Date: 05/17/2025 The initial eradication of the human population in Sector 7 was completed efficiently. The remaining specimens present high behavioral variability, making it difficult to capture without compromising resources. Humans are fragile, emotionally unstable organisms, yet they exhibit surprising adaptive potential. Its biology is a mix of surprising resistance and susceptibility to conventional methods of neutralization. The practice of substitution — mimicking hosts — has proven effective in infiltrating resistant groups, although the human cognitive pattern is still a challenge to replicate perfectly. Identification based on physical anomalies, such as rudimentary tails, additional eyes, or unusual tusks, remains the primary screening method. The “pet” developed from the human host proved to be a valuable tool for local control. The requirement for continuous consumption of human tissue to maintain the bond does not present any apparent risks to the operator, although it generates psychological resistance, which must be monitored. The warning signs detected, such as abrupt environmental changes and anomalous behavior of terrestrial fauna, indicate an acute sensory response of local specimens, which should be considered for future planning. I recommend intensifying containment measures, with special attention to isolated individuals who demonstrate resistance to the standard protocol. Eradication must be total, even if the biological cost is high. Humanity will not be restored. The invaders dominate. The cycle of consumption and replacement continues. End of report.",

When his son went missing Craig was desperate, and he knew that if he went up to women's boobs and started talking to their boobs, he will surely be slapped and beaten. So the next best thing was to go up to a man with man boobs. He spotted a large man with man boobs and he seemed like a proper man's man, and he was sure that he would take offence at him talking to his man boobs. Craig had no choice though and he went up to this large man and in front of all his friends, he started to talk to this man's man boobs. He asked the man's man boobs about his sons whereabouts. The man boobs started to converse back with Craig and they showed him where his son was. Craig was relieved to find that his son was with his friend in some forest and that they were both safe. Craig now relieved of this worry, but had something else to worry about. The man he chose to talk to his man boobs was embarrassed and in front of all his friends, the man was not happy. Craig tried to apologise so much and told him that he couldn't go up to a woman and talk to their boobs as that would be ungentlemanly. The man shouted back at Craig by saying \"so you embarrass me by talking to my man boobs in front of all my friends!\" And then when one of the man's friends starts to laugh, the man knocks his friend out and starts to pummel him. Craig just walks away and he was just grateful that his son was safe. Then a couple of months go by and Craig's son is missing again. Craig is desperate again and it's a Saturday night and he needs someone's boobs to talk to. He finds that same man and he is looking at Craig. Craig isn't going to go up to a woman's boobs and talk to her boobs as that is not right. So talking to this man's man boobs is acceptable. So Craig went up to this man again who he spotted at the same bar, and he started talking to his man boobs. His man boobs told Craig how this man had been secretly stalking him and how he took his son, and beat him to death after grabbing him from his walk home from the gym. The sons body is in the man's home. \"Everything okay\" the man asked Craig with a menacing smile \"You murdered my son...\" Craig told this man \"And that's what you get for embarrassing me by talking to my man boobs\" the man replied",

As he sat down on the sand and looked upon the never ending desert, he started to hear all of the voices in his past. He started to hear the lost friends, enemies and relationships. Then suddenly something appeared next to him and it was a jinn. It was half human and half donkey like, and its eyes were of all colours. The Jinn smiled at the man but this man was not scared, it is not the first jinn he has encountered. \"Why did you murder your daughter?\" The jinn asked the man When the man heard the jinn asking him about why he killed his daughter, the man started to choke up a little bit and his eyes became teary. Then he controlled himself from becoming emotional, and he looked at the smiling jinn and he said \"she loved a man from an enemy tribe, I couldn't have that\" and he then looked away at the longing desert. The jinn then had a look of concern and the jinn said \"you couldn't have just let her go\" and the man with such pride had replied back to the jinn by saying \"no I couldn't! It was a matter of honor\" The jinn seemed to feed off from the man's pride and anger. Then the man had a flash back of strangling his daughter to save the honor of his family, he then burst into tears and the screamed out into the desert. The jinn then smiled and said to the man \"who are you screaming at?\" And the man just sat back down on the desert sand. Then the jinn looked at the man and said \"don't you remember me? I'm the one who possessed your mother when you were a child\" and the jinn smiled. The man then had a flash back of his mother being possessed by a jinn and she was doing other worldly things. Then the Jinn smiled and said to the man \"I made her say blasphemous things against God and made her do unwomanly things! And what did you guys do?\" The jinn smiled as the jinn knew exactly what he had done. The man was a child when the jinn had possessed his mother and his father decided to stone her for doing ungodly things. The son also joined in the stoning of his mother. A tear rolled off his eyes and he looked at the jinn and he said \"I don't care what i did\" and the jinn fed off his pride. \"You see my clan of jinns is at war with another clan of jinns. A man's pride like yours feeds us and makes us stronger to fight\" and then the man saw that he was surrounded by millions of jinns who were all feeding off his pride.",

      "content": "My name is Lucas. I'm twenty-four years old, but after what I've experienced... I think I've died a few times inside. I found the ritual online, on one of those hidden pages on the internet, lost among forums and deleted comments. It was called “The Door Game”. And promised to return anything lost. Or someone. I didn't think twice. I just wanted my sister back. It was exactly three in the morning when I closed the door to the back bathroom of my grandmother's house. It was the only one without a mirror and with a bathtub. I took with me three white candles, an old Bible stained with mold, coarse salt and my cell phone to use the timer. I locked all the doors. Each one. Three times. I checked the locks until my fingers started to bleed with anxiety. The windows too, boarded up. I wanted to follow every damn rule perfectly. I placed the candles in a triangle in front of the door and sat in front of them, my hands shaking. I set the timer for 3 minutes and 33 seconds and began. I knocked on the door. “Give it back.” I knocked again. “Give it back.” Sixty-six times. The throat dries up. Goose bumps. My eyes burned with tears that I didn't notice. On beat 66, I paused the stopwatch. There were exactly 7 seconds left. I whispered the words as I read: “I want it back, so I’ll get it, here’s the word so you can do it.” Seven beats. Then I slammed the Bible hard against the bottom of the bathtub. The candles went out. And the silence that followed… was unnatural. It was not a silence of absence. It was that of something he observed. Something that breathed on the other side of the door. I poured the salt around the tub with shaking hands. I turned on the water. I waited. She turned white. But then... I don't know if it was my imagination, or if the lights flickered... For a moment, I swear I saw shadows creeping behind the bathtub curtain. And then the water started to bubble. As if it were boiling. The smell of burning flesh filled the bathroom. My eyes were watering. The water turned blue. I had done everything right. He appeared. The Dealer. Dressed in a white robe, but his face… there was no face. Just smooth skin, sewn together at the corners, as if someone had ripped out everything that made him human and sealed it there with rusty iron wires. His fingers were too long, thin, and ended in nails that looked like slivers of black glass. He didn't speak. He just extended one hand. And on the other… In the other was my sister's teddy bear. What she held in the coffin. What I buried myself. I accepted the object and cried. Two days later, my sister was home. But not like before. She watched me at dawn, standing at the edge of my bed, her eyes completely black. Smiled, even when I cried. And she… talked to him. I heard. I heard whispers coming from the bathtub. Each night, she became more… rotten. The flesh on his face was beginning to sag, as if it were decomposing again. And then I understood. I didn't bring her back. I brought what was left of it. I tried to repeat the ritual. But it was rule 16. Never complete the ritual again. On the third strike of the second attempt, the bathroom was filled with unbearable heat. The walls started to bleed. Literally. Blood dripped from the tiles. The bathtub creaked like it was about to explode. And the dealer… He entered. He ripped my jaw off with his bare hands. I only survived because my grandmother broke down the door when she heard the screams. But she saw nothing. Didn't see him. He didn't even see my sister. Today, I am confined to a bed, fed by tubes, unable to speak. But I see. It's still there, in the corner of the room. He watches. Waiting for someone to lose something again. Don't play The Door Game. Not everything that is lost deserves to be found again. Continues...",

      "content": "They arrived without warning. No lights in the sky, no ships in formation. Just sudden disappearances, choked screams and thick stains of blood running down the gutters. The first thing I did was destroy my phone. The sharp crack of the screen breaking beneath my boot was almost comforting, as if each splinter took me a little further away from what was to come. The city fell into silence. Even the dogs stopped barking. It was as if the very air had been sucked out by some invisible force, leaving only a damp, soggy whisper of flesh in its place. I saw my neighbor—or what used to be him—the next morning. His eyes looked normal until they flickered to the side. When he smiled, there was something pulsing under the skin of his cheek, as if additional teeth were trying to tear his face from the inside out. Don't confront. Don't talk. Just go. I fled to the woods and dug with my bare hands, until the nails came loose and the blood mixed with the earth. A hole, a shelter, a makeshift grave—anything that could keep me out of their sight. For some reason I don't understand, they can't see into holes like that. Maybe they are too proud to look down. Maybe they know that worms crawl there and respect them. The food ran out on the fifth day. In the seventh, water. On the ninth, I heard the first child laughing outside. The sound was hollow, as if her lungs were filled with water or gas. When I looked through the crack in the wood, I saw a tiny creature with human skin stretched like wet paper over a structure that was not human. She looked straight at me. She knew. I killed a man to feed the creature that followed me there. It was like a dog... or almost so. He had eyes like bubbles of boiling blood and a tongue that hissed names I never learned. He licked the pieces of meat as if they were sweets. He protected me for three nights. On the fourth, he bit my leg. He said he needed to make sure I was “his.” Now, hiding in this hole, my blood runs down the wood. I write with the fingers I still have left, hoping someone will find this notice. Don't trust anyone. Not even on me. They can change shape. They can dress your mother, your best friend, your son. But they can never hide the smell. A metallic smell, of burnt flesh and boiled bones. A smell that I now smell of myself. Maybe I've already been replaced. Perhaps this report is not a warning. Maybe it's a trap. But you're already reading, aren't you? Good luck.",

It was there that Clara went, determined to change her destiny. Alone, in the dust-covered attic, she traced a circle of ancient words with red chalk. Words that only appeared in burned grimoires and deleted internet forums. In the center of the circle, a mirror. A mirror that her grandmother said was \"older than the truth.\" With a breath and a cut on her finger, she pronounced her wish: \"Make me the queen of everything I see.\" From the mirror, a shadow emerged. A figure that had no fixed shape, but had eyes that never blinked and a smile that never faded. A genius — or what was left of one. \"Granted,\" he said, in a voice like broken glass. In the next instant, Clara screamed. His hands went to his eyes, now black, opaque, irreversibly damaged. She staggered back, crying, begging for sense. The genius, unfazed, just watched. \"Your kingdom is beautiful, isn't it?\" he whispered, disappearing into the cracked mirror. Today, they say that Clara still lives in that house. Sitting in the center of the attic, with a blank smile and dead eyes, she reaches out into nothingness, proclaiming her silent dominance. For, for those who see nothing, every place is a kingdom.

      "content": "I work night shift security in an office building downtown. Nothing glamorous — just ten floors of locked doors, flickering lights, and vending machines that never work. I mostly sit at the monitors, walk a couple laps each night, and stay awake until my 6 a.m. relief shows up. The building has one weird feature: a single fire exit on the south stairwell, halfway between the 6th and 7th floors, that’s been permanently sealed. Bolted shut. Steel-reinforced. It has a red sign over it that says: “DO NOT OPEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES” I asked my supervisor about it when I first started. He just said, “Old story. Ignore it.” But last week, I heard knocking from the other side. It was 2:23 a.m. I was on my routine floor sweep when I heard it—three quick knocks. Then nothing. I froze. I was standing directly next to the sealed fire exit. I waited. Knock. Knock-knock. Not fast. Not desperate. Just…rhythmic. I stepped back, reached for my radio, then stopped. What was I going to say? “There’s knocking behind a door no one’s supposed to open”? I didn’t want to be that guy a weekend into the job. But I did mark the time in my logbook. The next night, it happened again. Same time. Same pattern. I pressed my ear to the door. Nothing. Cold metal. No voice. No breath. Just that faint sense of pressure on the other side, like something was close. I checked the stairwell cameras when I got back to the desk. Here’s the thing: the camera facing the south stairwell near the fire exit glitches out every night between 2:21 and 2:27 a.m. I went back a week in the system, and every night — right around that time — it cuts to static for six minutes. Not motion-triggered. Not a blackout. Just that one camera. I asked the day shift guy if he ever noticed. He said, “Oh, that? Yeah. It’s been like that for years. The tech guys gave up trying to fix it.” Last night, I made the mistake of waiting for it. I brought my phone, put in a fresh battery for my flashlight, and sat on the stairs near the door at 2:20 a.m. Nothing for two minutes. Then came the knocking. But this time… something responded. A voice, low and flat, said: “It’s safe now. You can open it.” It sounded like my voice. I backed up, heart pounding. “Who’s there?” I asked. The voice came again: “You. You know me. Let me out.” I nearly ran — but forced myself to stay. I put my phone under the door and recorded audio. Thirty seconds in, there’s this dragging sound. Like nails or fingers scraping metal. Then silence. Then whispering. I took the phone back and played the recording. And that’s when I realized something was horribly wrong. The whisper on the recording wasn’t the voice I heard with my ears. The phone picked up a woman’s voice. She was saying my name. And sobbing. I went back to the monitors and replayed the stairwell footage for that night — despite the glitch, it saved five seconds of clear video at 2:25 a.m. For those five seconds, the door was open. Just slightly. Something pale was standing in the gap. Just enough for one eye to peer through. But the door in real life was still sealed when I went back. Bolted. Untouched. I submitted a maintenance report and didn’t mention the rest. Tonight’s my shift again. It’s already past 1 a.m. I’m writing this from the security desk while staring at that stairwell feed. Static just started early. Whatever’s behind that door is getting closer. I just hope it doesn’t learn how to open it from the other side.",

      "title": "Has anyone ever seen a show called Sleddy?",
      "content": "It was about this pink thing, your typical kids’ show where random stuff happens just to teach a lesson or moral, or sometimes the characters just act silly for a few minutes. I remember one episode where it did the laundry (even though Sleddy doesn’t wear clothes), another where it looked for food, and one where it played hide and seek... You get the idea. That’s the kind of show it was, but badly made. Even as a kid, I had the feeling it was... off. Not \"different and cool\", just cheap. And trust me, my critical thinking back then was garbage. I watched anything that was on. A few days ago, I found some old VHS tapes from when I was a kid, and among them were a few Sleddy episodes. It seemed impossible, but they’re even worse than I remembered. In some parts you can literally see the cardboard, and even someone’s hand moving the puppets. But the most disturbing part is the plotlines. There’s something off about them. Things happen that, if you stop to think about it, are seriously unsettling. Maybe because it was a kid’s show, no one ever paid close attention or stopped to look for any hidden meaning. The reason I’m sharing all of this is... because I’m scared. If anyone remembers anything or has information, please share it with me. I need to know I’m wrong. Let me explain… Maybe I’m just being paranoid, but there was this one episode with a shark character. He ends up drowning. Around the same time that episode aired, I remember a very well-known news story about a boy with my age who drowned. And in the photo from the article, he was wearing a shark t-shirt. Another episode shows a character hiding in a well during a game of hide and seek, and they never find him. That episode aired around the same time a real boy fell into a well. You see where I’m going with this? I also found an episode where an orange flower dies. In my neighborhood, there was a little girl who loved Sleddy. Her mom used to call her “my little orange flower.” As you can probably guess, she disappeared. That exact episode has been reuploaded online. Here’s the link: (It’s missing a few parts and the quality is terrible, but it’s the best I’ve found. I don’t know how to digitize my VHS tapes. If someone can help, I plan to upload them.) But back to what’s really bothering me. There’s an episode that feels... personal. I have a pretty unusual last name: Velcrowe. And in a Sleddy episode, there’s a family with that same last name. The father loses his job, and they have no money. Sleddy shows up and helps them by taking one of the children away so the rest of the family can survive until things get better. Now, guess who almost got kidnapped as a child shortly after his father lost his job? Exactly, me. That was over 20 years ago. I shouldn’t still be thinking about it. If there really were some lunatics making this low-budget show and then targeting kids, it was ages ago. There shouldn’t be any link to me anymore. I didn’t even remember the show until a few days ago. But while I was going over the tapes, my young son saw that last episode and said, “That character looks like you, Dad.” He was pointing at the father, mister. Velcrowe, in the show. And today… I got fired. I know I’m being paranoid. But now I’m scared to leave my son alone. I’m scared one of these “coincidences” might happen again.",

Navigate eerie classrooms, solve cryptic puzzles, and uncover the truth behind the 'Forgotten Student' incident of 1999. But be warned—some doors should never be opened.\" (Note: No records of \"Greenwood Academy\" or \"Moonlight woods.co\" exist. The game’s ISO was allegedly recovered from a water-damaged floppy disk.) as far as i was aware Dark Forest Studio never existed. i should’ve never have clicked that stupid link. i downloaded and booted the game with butterflies in my stomach. there’s no way i found a lost game right? the loading screen was exactly what i expected. a very pixelated picture of a school in the woods, rotting. leaf vines climbing the walls in such a way that they looked like veins. broken windows that had been pushed to their limits by the elements with a slowed and pitched version of the song “pop goes the weasel” in the background. “start new game” “load game save” “attendance sheet” “quit game” attendance sheet? what was that? some kind of game credits? i clicked the option.",

      "title": "¿Alguien vio una serie llamada Sleddy?",
      "content": "Era sobre una cosa rosa, la típica serie infantil en la que ocurre cualquier chorrada para contar una moraleja, una enseñanza, o simplemente los personajes están haciendo tonterías durante unos minutos. Recuerdo un capítulo en el que ponía la colada (aunque el Sleddy no lleva ropa), otro en el que iba a buscar comida, otro que jugaba al escondite,... Imagino que así os hacéis una idea. Pues la serie es eso, pero mal hecho. De pequeño ya me daba la impresión de que era algo diferente a las otras series que veía, pero diferente de pensar: es cutre. Y eso que de pequeño mi nivel crítico era una mierda. Me veía cualquier cosa que ponían. Hace unos días me encontré con los VHS que tenía de pequeño y entre ellos había algunos capítulos. Parecía imposible, pero es peor de lo que recordaba, hay partes que se ve cartón, y hasta la mano de uno de los de la serie moviendo los muñecos. Pero lo más perturbador son las tramas, tienen algo raro, pasan cosas que si te paras a pensarlo dan muy mal rollo. Quizás al ser una serie infantil nadie le prestaba atención ni se paraban a pensar el doble significado. El tema por el que comparto todo esto es porque ahora tengo miedo. Necesito que si alguien recuerda algo o tiene información la comparta conmigo. Necesito comprobar que me equivoco. Os cuento… Quizá es solo mi mente siendo paranoica, pero en un capítulo había un personaje de un tiburón y este acaba ahogado. Por las mismas fechas que se emitió el capítulo, recuerdo una noticia muy famosa de un chico de mi edad que se ahogó, y en la foto de la noticia tenía una camiseta de un tiburón. En otro capítulo, un personaje de Sleddy se escondía en un pozo mientras jugaban al escondite y nunca lo encontraban. El capítulo ocurría en la misma fecha en la que un niño en la vida real se cayó a un pozo. Veis por donde voy, ¿no? También encontré un capítulo en el que muere una flor naranja, y en mi barrio había una niña muy fan de Sleddy que su madre la llamaba “mi florecita naranja”. Como podéis adivinar, desapareció. Justo este capítulo lo he encontrado resubido a Internet. Os dejo el enlace por aquí: Le falta alguna parte y está en mala calidad, pero es lo mejor que he encontrado. Los míos no sé cómo pasarlos de VHS a digital. Si alguien me ayuda tengo planeado subirlos. Pero volviendo a la parte que me preocupa, hay un capítulo que me recuerda a mí. Tengo un apellido poco usual, Velcrowe, y en un capítulo de Sleddy hay una familia con ese mismo apellido. El padre pierde el trabajo y no tienen dinero. Sleddy llega y les ayuda, se lleva a uno de los hijos para que así puedan permitirse vivir hasta que se recuperen. Ahora, con todo esto, ¿adivináis a quién intentaron secuestrar de pequeño poco después de que su padre perdiera el trabajo? Exacto, a mí. Esto ocurrió hace más de 20 años, no debería preocuparme ya. Si realmente había unos locos que grababan esta serie cutre y luego mataban niños, fue hace tanto tiempo que ya no debería quedar ninguna relación conmigo. Si ni yo mismo recordaba la serie hasta hace unos días. Pero mientras revisaba los capítulos, mi hijo pequeño vio este último y dijo “Este personaje se parece a ti papa”. Era el padre Velcrowe en la serie, y hoy me han despedido. Estoy siendo paranoico, lo sé, pero ahora tengo miedo de separarme de mi hijo y que se cumpla otra de estas “coincidencias”.",

      "content": "I moved into this old rental house last month. It’s in a quiet neighborhood, cheap rent, nothing too weird. except the bathroom. The mirror above the sink is old, almost antique-looking. But when I first cleaned it, I noticed the frame wasn’t sealed to the wall properly. The whole thing wobbled. So last week, out of curiosity, I pulled it off completely. Behind it was a narrow wooden door. No handle. Just a keyhole and warped wood. There’s nothing on the floorplan about a closet or crawlspace behind that wall. I left it alone for a day or two. Told myself it was probably some sealed-off cabinet. But… things started happening. At night, I hear something behind the wall. Not rats. Not plumbing. Breathing. Like slow, shallow breaths — right up against the other side of that door. I finally broke and pried it open last night using a flathead screwdriver. It wasn’t a closet. It was a tunnel. Narrow. Cold. Carved directly into the stone. And it went deep — way deeper than the dimensions of the house should allow. I only stepped inside for a second. The air felt wrong. Heavy. Like I’d walked into a cellar that hadn't been opened in 100 years. I swear I heard something move further in. I closed it. Hard. Hammered nails into the frame. Put the mirror back. Told myself I imagined it. But tonight, the mirror is cracked — from the inside. And I can hear breathing again. Closer now.",

      "content": "It was supposed to be a routine reconnaissance mission. A group of four soldiers were sent to Military Restricted Area Echo-9, a base abandoned after an alleged biological leak. No official documents confirmed this, and all information about the location had been classified. But there were rumors. Rumors that what was created there should not exist. The group was led by Sergeant Toledo, a seasoned veteran, accompanied by Ramos, a demolitions specialist, Lira, a sniper, and Costa, the youngest and most eager of the group. Echo-9's entrance was suffocating. The main gate had been sealed with twisted steel plates from the inside, as if something immense had tried to break out. They used explosives to open a passage. The smell that escaped wasn't mold or rust—it was rotten, organic, like meat fermenting in the sun for weeks. Right at the entrance, they found remains of military uniforms... and bones. But the bones were clean, polished, as if they had been boiled. Some still had remnants of blackened flesh glued to the structure. No animal would do that. Not with surgical precision. Emergency lights flashed, powered by automatic generators that were still working, strangely. The walls were covered in strange symbols scratched with fingernails or claws. Some messages were in English, others in something indecipherable. One of them said: “THEY HEAR THE BONES CRACK”. In the early hours, the radio still worked. After descending three levels, contact with the surface was severed. The air there was thicker. There was damp on the walls, as if the concrete was sweating blood. And perhaps it was — in some parts, a viscous red liquid oozed that moved against gravity. On the fourth level, they found the central laboratory. Cages with destroyed bars, scratches on the walls, claw marks... and what was left of the scientists: bodies hanging by their tendons, tied like meat to refrigerator hooks. The eyes were gouged out, the skin was opened in patterns that imitated organizational charts — each muscle exposed with numbered labels. It was as if something was studying the human anatomy... from the inside. Costa vomited. But he wasn't the only one to lose control. Ramos started to laugh. Short, sharp laughs, until you bang your head against the wall repeatedly. He said he heard a voice coming from the floor, “asking to come in.” When they tried to restrain him, he bit his own wrist until pieces of flesh were ripped off. He died choking on his own blood. And then they appeared. Deformed beings, humans only in form — but without skin, without eyes, with pulsating muscles covered in what looked like black mucus. They walked slowly, but they always knew where the soldiers were. They were guided by sound. Any sigh was death. Lira was next. He tried to shoot, but one of the creatures screamed. A scream that wasn't sound, but vibration. Her body exploded from the inside out. The skull was crushed by internal pressure, the eyes bulged out of their sockets and the tongue came out through the torn trachea. Toledo and Costa ran. They went up to the second level. They found a monitoring room that was still active. The cameras showed hundreds of those things. Some trapped in rooms, others dragging human remains, others... standing still, as if waiting. Toledo ordered Costa to run with the data. He himself stayed to trigger the self-destruction of the complex. When Costa turned to run, he saw Toledo being surrounded by the creatures. They didn't attack him right away. They opened their mouths in deafening silence, while one of them stuck her fingers into the sergeant's eye sockets, pulling out his still alive eyeballs. The camera turned off. Costa arrived at the surface with half his face burned by a corrosive gas escaping from the pipes. Loaded the hard drive. Took him to command... but everything was confiscated. A month later, he disappeared. On the wall of his accommodation, someone wrote in his own blood: “WE ESCAPE IN HIS BONE.” Echo-9 remains sealed. Officially, it has been deactivated. But sometimes at night, satellites pick up electronic whispers coming from the depths. On a frequency that shouldn't exist. Whispers that say: \"More meat. More eyes. More bones.\"",

      "content": "I’ve been working night shifts at a small hotel in northern Greece for the past two years. It's a quiet place—only 4 floors, mostly older tourists, nothing exciting. I actually like the silence. But about a month ago, something weird happened. A couple checked in around 11:30 p.m.—nothing unusual. They looked tired, barely said a word. The guy signed the check-in form, and before I could even offer them room options, he just said, “Room 313, please.” Here’s the thing: There is no room 313. Our third floor has rooms 301 to 312. I’ve walked those halls hundreds of times. I told him politely, “I think you mean 312, maybe?” He just smiled and said, “No. 313 is fine.” Before I could respond, he handed me a key. Not one of ours. Old metal key, red tag, 313 engraved. I froze. It felt… wrong in my hand. Cold, like it had been in a freezer. The woman with him hadn’t said a word. She just stared at me the whole time—eyes completely black. Not like horror-movie black, I mean… there was nothing there. No light, no reflection. Like two holes. They walked off toward the elevator without another word. I tried to stop them, explain again. But when I followed them upstairs—they were gone. No doors open. No sound. No sign of them. I checked the cameras. Elevator went up to 3rd. They stepped out. Walked down the hall toward 312. Then… they turned left. There isn’t a left turn there. Just a solid wall. But in the footage, they walk into the wall. And disappear. I showed it to my manager the next morning. He told me the cameras must’ve glitched and deleted the file. I didn’t imagine it. And I didn’t imagine what I found the next night: The key. On the front desk. Same red tag. Same number: 313. Since then, I hear a phone ringing every night around midnight. But only from that side of the third floor. From… nothing. I stopped going up there alone. Last night, I picked up the front desk phone, just to check the line. There was a voice. A whisper. “Room 313 is ready for you now.”",

      "title": "I witnessed a woman being kidnapped on the highway and ended up saving her life",
      "content": "Saturday morning, I was driving to work on the highway. I was in the middle lane and going quite fast because I was running a bit late. I nearly panicked when I noticed a car rapidly approaching from behind in my left side mirror. It was a black Honda Civic. I wondered who was behind the wheel and took a careful look at the car. It was still dark outside, but I could see the driver looking at me as he passed. Then I noticed someone else in the back seat. It was a young woman. She seemed to be hitting the rear window. I thought maybe someone was playing a prank on me. But when I saw the driver push the woman down from where she was hitting the window and swerve the car violently, I realized something was very wrong. That woman was asking for help. I sped up a bit and got behind them to follow. I saw the driver repeatedly swing his arm toward the back seat, as if he was punching her. The woman’s arms were flailing inside the car. I was witnessing a kidnapping right before my eyes. Just then, the brake lights of the car in front lit up and it started to slow down. The driver had realized I saw what was going on and that I was following him. As much as I wanted to save the woman, I didn’t know if the man was armed. Still, I took the next exit but didn’t fully leave the highway. I waited for the car to pass in front of me again, then cut across the grass back onto the road and sped up to catch them. I was on the phone with 911 at this point. I caught up to them again going nearly 150 km/h. But the man noticed me before I could get close. I tried to pass him, but he swerved in front of me, forcing me to stop. Then he got out of his car. He had something in his hand and started running toward my car. Panicked, I threw the car into reverse and backed up until he stopped chasing me. Then I quickly shifted back into drive and sped past him before he could return to his car. The 911 operator told me that a state trooper was ahead of us and asked me to keep going until I reached them. The man was still chasing me, and our speed was insane—this time we were going around 180 km/h. When I saw the flashing red and blue lights in my rearview mirror, I felt like a mountain had been lifted off my chest. I was in front, the man in the middle, and the police car behind him. The man couldn’t maneuver and soon had to pull over onto the grass. I stopped in front of him but left two car lengths between us because I still didn’t know what might happen. Luckily, the officer had his gun drawn and got the man out of the car with his hands up. I got out too and watched everything unfold. The man was forced to the ground and handcuffed. Soon another police car arrived. Another officer got involved and helped get the woman out of the back seat. She had been badly beaten, was in tears, but overjoyed to be rescued. She kept turning to me, thanking me for saving her life. The driver turned out to be her ex-boyfriend. He had come to her house, and when she refused to talk to him, he attacked her and forced her into the car. Because the car had child locks, she couldn’t get out. But if I or someone else hadn’t seen her silent cries for help through that rear window, she might never have been saved. Check out more True Car Driving Horror Stories",

I took a peek down the hall. There he was, posture slouched like a zombie, his arms dangling dead. He slowly turned his head to me, the white eyes met mine. He did nothing, just stared, never took a step closer to me. He didn't seem nude but he also didn't seem clothed. As a matter of fact he didn't seem real. Just a shroud of dark mist in the shape of a man. The eyes ingrained themselves into my memory. After that day I named him the Night Watcher, every once in a while I see him doing just that. Watching, Analyzing, Waiting. I'm not sure why, but I feel safe in the light. But this thing, He won't leave me alone.",

Everything was fine at first, picture was taken of planets such as jupiter and uranus when it go near it, the system was fine and everything seems to go well and soon we can know what outside the solar system really look like. Everything changed when voyager finally cross the heliopause, voyager stop sending back signal, communication with voyager was lost for a few days. Finally after about a week, voyager respond with a image, that when the horror kick in, the space was empty no bright galaxies, no shiny stars, just darkness with a only 2 bright dot indicates 2 stars. Everything we saw was a illusion, created by our own solar system to keep us safe. There something out there and it been devour everything, but we aren’t sure. We lost communication with voyager 1 after that, years later voyager 2 was launched and this time it sent back only a image as well but this time there only 1 dot on the picture, we were certain, something is here and it trying to get us, the only reason it haven’t is because there a barrier protect us from it, created by our solar system. But i wonder, how long it gonna take for those “thing” to start destroying our world, how long will it take for them to pass our “barrier” Notes: this is not my work, it was something i read in the past so all the credit go to the author of this, this might also be an scp story but it been long so im not sure",

      "content": "The whole world is on diddys list and now everyone must be interviewed. The names on diddys list kept getting larger and larger, and then it had the names of every single living individual who is alive right now. So we had to start interviewing every person on planet earth. A bunch of interviewers came to my area and they were interviewing everyone, and why their names ended up on the list. I mean they even interviewed 90 year old Sharon! And why would she be on diddys list. They even interviewed people on the other side of the world, and who had never been to America before. Then they started to question me. I mean I have never met Diddy and I am just some random guy who deals with the bins. They asked my where I was at certain dates that diddy had committed a crime on. I told them during that time I was working with a guy and I was trying to figure out his super power. I also told them how I didn't feel like chopping people up and sewing them up. I enjoyed chopping people up and sowing up their limbs with different bodies, it was such a great hobby. Next to this colleague though I didn't feel like doing any of that. I started to realise how I was hurting people and ruining families. I felt really bad and my co worker smiled at me and said \"can you guess my power now?\" But I still didn't know. Then my co-worker told me what his powers were. Anyone who goes close to him they become good people, and they won't feel like doing anything bad and they will have sympathy. He has the most wonderful power. Then I was let go as I showed proof of my work and whereabouts on certain dates. Then when they interviewed another guy on diddys list, it was some druggy called tuppy and he has no eye lids because he is part of a secret society of no eye lids. Tuppy told the interviewers how his eyes have been opened ever since his eye lids had been cut off. He has realised that it's not the perpetrators of a crime that get punished, but it's the good people that get punished for crimes. When tuppy was asked where he was at certain dates that Diddy was doing bad stuff, tuppy answered them. Tuppy was stealing during those times as he had no eye lids, and innocent good people were punished for it. It's going to be a long day for the interviewers.",

      "content": "The pottery of São Bento do Lajeado rested in silence for almost forty years. Since the explosion of the central furnace in August 1986, the weeds had devoured the warehouses, the chimneys were crumbling under the weight of the years, and the hardened red clay crunched under the feet of anyone who dared to step there. Two men died in the tragedy, according to the newspapers — charred in such a way that there was no wake. But not everyone believed this version. The city, small and suspicious, carried its own truths: it was said that the pottery was cursed, that it “fed” something beneath the foundations. Children came back from there with purple marks on their arms and eyes full of terror. Dogs barked at the empty air as they passed nearby. But like all good macabre stories from the interior, it became a legend. And, like all legends, it was forgotten for too long. Until Renato Schwan arrived. A middle-aged archaeologist specializing in colonial artifacts, Renato had obtained federal funding for a series of excavations at ancient brickworks in southern Brazil. São Bento, with its history stained with clay and smoke, was perfect. Disbelieving local superstitions, he set up his small camp next to the main shed — or what was left of it. For the first two days, he found only rusty tools and fragments of pottery. But on the third day, while digging near the base of one of the ovens, his pickaxe found something different: a hollow sound. Behind a thick layer of clay, a smooth wall was revealed, without grout or industrial marks. It was pure clay, dry on the outside and slightly damp on the inside. When he broke it, he found a dark and stuffy cavity. He went down alone. Inside, the air was warm, smelling of wet earth and old flesh. The walls were covered with bodies. Not stacked — but embedded in the clay as parts of the structure. Men and women, all without jaws, with cracked skulls and exposed ribs, linked together by wires. The clay seemed to have grown around them, as if it had swallowed them alive. Renato backed away, but slipped. He fell into a soft mound. When he felt, he realized that it wasn't earth: it was flesh. And it pulsed. Before him, something rose. The creature had a human shape, but was not made of ordinary flesh. Its body was composed of a mixture of raw muscles and wet red clay, as if it had been molded and partially baked in a primitive oven. The skin, or what replaced the skin, was a cracked, hardened crust, exuding steam. The arms were long, the hands composed of fingers of polished bone, sharp as blades. But the most horrible thing was the mouth — a horizontal slit that ripped through the entire face, stitched together by shards of pottery, exposing rows of human teeth, all different in shape and color, as if collected from victims over the years. Renato tried to scream, but the creature was faster. He advanced with silent, surgical force. The archaeologist barely had time to raise his arms before the jaw was ripped from his face with a wet snap. Then fingers of hot clay pierced his stomach and extracted, with sickening slowness, pieces of intestine as if rolling strands of fresh dough. The next day, his assistant found the body. Or what's left. Renato was kneeling in front of the oven, his face turned to the wall, his lower jaw replaced by a mold of still-damp red clay. In the eyes, two small bricks. On the floor, a small altar made with vertebrae, teeth and ceramic fragments, on which there was a single, freshly molded brick, still hot. Engraved on it, in crooked and deep letters, it read: “EVERY OVEN NEEDS FUEL.” Since then, residents claim to see smoke coming from the abandoned brickworks, even on rainy days. Some hear muffled screams. Others swear they have found footprints made in fresh clay even weeks after the rain stopped. But no one goes in there anymore. Well, the oven came back on. And he's hungry.",

The man was just staring at her and Rachel knew that she had to move away. Then as Rachel started to walk away again, more men started to come back to life because they thought that Rachel loved them. Then Rachel was brave and just stood still and all those men were inspecting her. They were inspecting whether she was interested in them, but then they realised that Rachel wasn't interested in them and they went back to being dead. A women being interested and giving attention is life giving to them. So all women must stand still and there are safe moments where a woman can move, but that's only when the green clouds are over them. It's hard for girls to learn how to stand still but they must learn, so that when they become women, other men won't think they they like them. Rachel is standing still but a tiny hair on her neck moved a little, and it brought to life a man. This man thinks that she loves him and he stunk so much that she moved. Her movement caused more to come back to life. When will that green cloud come?",

      "title": "The Last Tenant of Apartment 5B",
      "content": "Paris, 11th arrondissement. An old Haussmann-era building—elegant façade, but decaying. The story unfolds in 2024, in a realistic modern-day context, blending mundane life with growing unease. Characters: Thomas, 29, freelance developer, newly moved to Paris, rational, suffers from chronic insomnia. Madame Vacquier, 84, the downstairs neighbor—polite but strange, seems to know everything about everyone. * Ysé, 25, a local bartender, befriends Thomas. Sensitive to the supernatural, believes in “cursed places.” Thomas moves into 5B, a modest but charming studio: old hardwood floors, a decorative fireplace, and an antique mirror above the mantel. The rent is suspiciously low. The real estate agent, rushed, only said: “Previous tenants never stayed long. Something about the soundproofing.” That first night, Thomas hears dull noises inside the walls. He assumes it’s the plumbing. But the sounds start to resemble whispers. Sometimes, scratching—coming from behind the mirror. The mirror looks older than the building itself. Slightly cracked, it's sealed to the wall. One sleepless night, Thomas stares at his reflection. He blinks. His reflection doesn’t. And for a second... it looks back differently. Ysé tells him a mass suicide occurred in the building in the 1980s—in Apartment 5B. A group of occultists practiced “soul dislocation.” Their leader believed in an inner reflection capable of trapping souls. Skeptical, Thomas digs through city records: in 1983, four bodies were found seated before the mirror, eyes burned out, the wood beneath them scorched. No signs of forced entry. Thomas begins locking his door at night. Still, objects shift places. Pages are torn from his notebook. One morning, he finds a note tucked in his bed: \"I've been here longer than you.\" He thinks he’s losing his mind. But his webcam records something disturbing: at 3:12 a.m., he rises from bed, slowly, stands before the mirror... and speaks in a guttural, unknown language. He remembers none of it. Madame Vacquier finally confesses, her eyes trembling: “You’re not the first. The other... the reflection... it copies. And when it’s ready, it takes.” She shows him an old photo from forty years ago: a man in the mirror. Identical to Thomas. Same scar on the lip. Same birthmark on the temple. That man died in 1983. Ysé tries to help Thomas remove the mirror. At midnight, they pry at it with a crowbar. When it breaks, the wall behind reveals a narrow hallway—lined with cracked mirrors, stretching into darkness. Inside: twisted human silhouettes, walking silently. A hand grabs Thomas, dragging him inside. Today, the apartment is vacant again. 5B. The agency mentions nothing. The mirror has been replaced. The new tenant is named Juliette. She occasionally notices her reflection… smiling without her. And every night at 3:12 a.m., she dreams of a glass hallway, where someone whispers her name.",

      "title": "The Song of the Deadwood",
      "content": "Some forests grow with twisted trees, as if trying to escape something. Rochegrive, deep in the remote hills of Corrèze, is one of those places. Nobody talks about it. Not even IGN maps show it. But there's a trail—if you know where to look. And if you're foolish enough to follow it... Characters: Julien, 32, urban exploration photographer, rational, always chasing the next thrill. Claire, 30, ethnobotanist, fascinated by rural legends, more sensitive to the unseen. Victor, 35, Claire’s brother, reserved, former soldier recently back from a disturbing mission. Twigs cracked underfoot. The trail sank into a tunnel of black pines. The branches twisted above, blotting out the sky. The trio moved in silence. Julien filmed everything, fascinated. “Not even birdsong...” Claire whispered. They reached their destination at dusk: the Glassmaker's House, a crumbling ruin with a shattered greenhouse, strangled in dead vines. According to local legend, a 19th-century hermit, Albin Tissier, lived here alone after claiming he could “hear the trees sing.” Some say he spoke to the dead. Others say he answered them. Night fell. Wind moaned through the broken glass like a dying breath. Julien insisted on sleeping there. Claire hesitated. Victor said nothing, cleaning his gun with slow precision. At midnight, a sharp sound woke Claire. She thought she saw someone standing behind the greenhouse glass. She approached… nothing. But an unsettling smell lingered—rotting wood and cold blood. She found a notebook beneath a floorboard. In it, a single passage: “They sing inside me. They scrape the marrow.” The next day, Victor showed Claire markings carved into trees near the house: overlapping circles, distorted spirals, and at the center—an empty eye. He claimed he’d seen identical symbols in a remote Afghan village. They had their own legend—of singing trees in the hills. Julien, meanwhile, spent the day in the cellar. Behind a crumbling wall, he found a well. Deep. He dropped a stone. No sound. The second night, things unraveled. Julien woke drenched in sweat. He dreamed of being tied to a tree, roots piercing his skin and whispering into his bones. When he stood, his ears were bleeding. Claire found Victor outside, kneeling, whispering in a language she didn’t recognize. Then, in a flat, emotionless voice: “We have to give something back.” That night, Julien descended into the well with a rope and his headlamp. His camera stayed on. At thirty meters down—solid ground. A floor made of moving roots. And skulls. Hundreds. The video cut. But the audio kept rolling. A low hum at first. Then whispers. Then—a song. Not human. Off-key, sung by mouths without tongues, rising from the bowels of the world. Claire found Victor kneeling by the well, murmuring prayers. He said the forest had chosen him. That Julien was taken—and that was fair. That the song calls to those who can hear. Claire ran. Into the woods. The trees closed in. Paths vanished. The song was everywhere—beneath her feet, inside her bones, behind her eyes*. She collapsed, gasping. And then—she wasn’t alone. A shape emerged: Julien—or what was left of him. His eyes were black. Veins dark as bark pulsed beneath his skin. He was humming. Julien’s video surfaced later on an urban exploration forum. No one knows who uploaded it. It ends on a blurry shot of the greenhouse, then… a face in the reflection. A twisted, wooden face. With hollow eyes. Since then, some viewers claim they hear a song—just after watching the video. A song that wakes them in the night. A song that calls.",

      "title": "What Happens When You Listen to Possessed by Twilijht? Ask Marcus. Ask Esther.",
      "content": "Marcus wasn’t the type to get caught up in anything strange. He was practical, focused. His taste in music was whatever came on the radio or what his friends sent him, but he didn’t seek much else. That was until he stumbled upon Possessed by Twilijht. It came up in his feed—just a recommendation. Something about the cover art piqued his curiosity. He clicked. Listened. At first, he thought it was just another weird track. The kind you listen to once, shrug at, and move on. But something about the sound—the way it twisted and warped as it played—stuck with him. He wasn’t one to go down the rabbit hole of dark music, but this? It was different. The first time he played it on his headphones, he felt a shift in the air. He didn’t tell anyone about it. He didn’t even acknowledge it to himself. But he couldn’t stop listening. It was a strange pull—almost magnetic. Something about the song felt like it was calling him. Calling to him, but not the Marcus he knew. He played it in the car the next day. Played it at work. Even played it as he walked through the grocery store, music thrumming through his ears. He started isolating himself, tuning out conversations, just letting the track guide him through the day. His coworkers noticed. His friends, too. He was quieter, more withdrawn. But he just shrugged it off. It was just a song. Right? Then things started to get strange. It wasn’t just the music anymore. It was what came with it. His thoughts began to feel out of place, like they weren’t his own. He kept hearing things in the song—things behind the sounds. Whispers, static, vibrations, frequencies that didn’t belong. He thought he was imagining it, but it was persistent. Constant. Marcus stopped eating regular meals. Said the song fed him in ways food couldn’t. He stopped replying to texts, answering calls, or leaving his apartment. His roommates were concerned, but when they tried to confront him, he didn’t respond. He wouldn’t even look at them. He just played the track—louder now, with the bass thumping so hard it rattled the walls. One night, his cousin knocked on his door. No answer. So he slipped a note under it. When Marcus finally opened the door, his eyes were different. There was something vacant there, like he wasn’t really looking at anything. Just through it. His cousin asked if everything was okay, but Marcus didn’t speak. He just handed him the note that read: “7.” Nothing else. Days passed, and his behavior grew more erratic. His whole life was reduced to the song, the 7, and the shadows in his apartment. He wrote strange things on scraps of paper—numbers, symbols, fragments of sentences. His walls were covered with them. The more he scribbled, the more obsessed he became. His friends and family gave up on trying to reach him. Marcus stopped talking altogether. He began pacing in circles, humming softly under his breath. His apartment—now a shrine to Possessed by Twilijht—became a place no one dared to visit. The music played in a loop, an endless cycle. His phone was silent. He never left. The only thing anyone ever heard from him again was a voicemail left on his cousin’s phone. All it said was: “I’m not here. But I’m here. The song’s in me now. And it’s showing me how to move through the walls. 7 is the answer.” That was weeks ago. Now, people only talk about Marcus in whispers. Some say he’s still locked in his apartment, but they don’t know for sure. His phone is off. His social media dormant. His family keeps quiet. But there’s a strange energy around his place. Like it’s waiting for something. They say the song never left. That it found him instead.",

      "content": "In my restaurant I made a deal where if your height is 5ft, then everything is for free. You can't be under 5 ft or over 5 ft, and you must be bang on 5 ft. I thought it was a good deal and it started to gain the attraction of the community. I have had this restaurant for 5 years and have never done a deal, so this will be the first ever deal I have ever done. I never have done any deals before as I am the sort of person that believes that you pay whatever the menu says. Some people were happy with it while others weren't. I am very popular and everyone loves the food we make. I remember some customers getting angry because they weren't exactly 5 ft. They were small but just under 5ft and some were just over 5 ft. I then had some tall guys coming into the restaurant and demanding free food. I told them that only people who are exactly 5 ft are entitled to free food and nether under or over that height. So yeah we had some people who were unhappy with us. This was the deal in my restaurant and I'm sticking with it. Then someone entered the restaurant and they were climbing on the floor, because they had chopped off their own legs. Blood was behind them and this guy wanted free food. When we measured him unfortunately he was still a little over 5 ft. He started to scream and shout that he had chopped off his own legs to become short. He is in poverty and needs food and drink. I told him that he still hasn't qualified for the deal. Then another guy crawled into the stories by climbing the floor, because he chopped off his whole legs and all that is left is his body. Unfortunately he was under 5ft and so he didn't qualify for the deal of free food. Then someone else came into the store, and I saw him coming into the store before but he was shorter than 5ft. Now he looked taller but he was over 5ft now and still didn't qualify for free food. He then threw 2 lumps of leg limbs at me. Some people were complaining how much of a terrible deal this was. I kept to my guns and then finally, someone who was bang on 5ft came into the store and he was allowed free food. This deal does work.",

      "content": "I've not slept in 3 days, and something is waiting for me... It all started May 11th when I got home, I felt something was off so I went to check if everything was alright, spoiler, it wasn't. All the lights were on (I need to mention I was coming back from work and I was sure I'd turned everything off) and it clearly freaked me out because I live alone and I had previously double-checked if everything was off before heading to work. I chose to ignore it, I figured it must be some electrical problem so I decided to hop on my bed to watch some Netflix series (highly recommend The Flash - if you like the comics you'll love it) and didn't think much of it. Hours passed, 0:21 AM, footsteps downstairs (my house has two floors, this will be important later) so clearly I didn't go down (horror movie characters are stupid, bleh, obviously, I thought I was getting robbed so it wasn't safe to go down). I turned off my room’s lights and stayed silent. Some minutes had passed and I figured I'd go down. As I was heading down the stairs, I heard something fall downstairs. I ran back to my room, locked the door as quick as possible but nothing came, so I just sat there quietly with my phone for a while. MAY 12TH I went to work unrested and had the worst day of my life, I felt like something was watching me, even the air in my own house felt strange, dense. I associated it with the sleep deprivation and ignored the fact I felt something behind me, watching every move I did. At night, I got up to sleep, tired and destroyed... but it didn't end there. When I was getting my bed ready to sleep I felt how something opened my room's door and got the lights on, I shut the door as fast as I could and stayed up watching some Netflix (again, but I needed to stay awake). Time passed by and I needed to grab an energy drink, I was thirsty as fuck and I needed some energy to stay up. That's when I saw it, meanwhile I was heading down I saw IT, the thing that had been watching me all day and got me restless. IT was black, pure black, it didn't have a mouth or a nose but somehow I could notice his expression. At least it had eyes with a big black iris that gave me chills. Its gaze was fixated on me, like it could see through me (but that's impossible, isn't it?). I ran back as fast as I could again, scared, it didn't even try to get me, it knew I would eventually come down in the night... MAY 13TH Today I called in sick to work and I've been up all day with zero rest, it's almost 6pm but i've kept my room's windows closed (The sunlight is hurting me due to my lack of sleep). The last time I got out of my room I couldn't believe it, there was something covering all the first floor, it seemed to be dark, as if it were the middle of the night. I know it is waiting for me, it wants me to come down, it wants to end me. But why?, why me? I've been a good person my whole life, I work from 12pm to 8pm (I work in a 24/7 retail store) and I haven't done anything bad to anyone, so... why? I'll give an update tomorrow, I want to rest, so i'll try to sleep now :) (If i don't post anything from now expect the worst, i'm probably dead). Oh, and I got this pic to get y'all to have an idea of what I saw that night:",

Through cellular reprogramming with a sequence of artificial nucleotides extracted from an ancient parasite found in Arctic permafrost, absolute regeneration was sought. But records show that after Rehearsal 31, everything spiraled out of control. Human subject 031-A, a death row inmate, was injected with the serum at 3:12 am. At 3:15 am, he started screaming.

A low hum was detected coming from the chest: the ribs were moving on their own, as if they were trying to leave the body. At 3:21 am, the patient's skull was torn open from the inside. The bone plates vibrated as if something was trying to come out. The autopsy video was found to be corrupted, but partial footage shows the following: — The heart was still beating, even outside the chest cavity. —There were eyes under the skin, all blinking uncoordinatedly. — The stomach regurgitated its own enzymes and dissolved the spine. — The guinea pig crawled on its side, smiling with half of its face necrotic and its teeth all inserted into its cheeks. On the wall of the chamber, written in gore and viscera, was the phrase: \"What dies must stay dead.\" The serum had done something beyond biology. He had rewritten the laws of the flesh. The frozen parasite wasn't just a being — it was a vector. A vehicle of something more. Something that didn't want to be discovered. After the incident, scientists decided to destroy the laboratory. But Rehearsal 31's body was never located. The last audio recorded in the installation's black box says, in scratchy whispers: \"They're still alive here... inside the wall... inside the skin. The serum doesn't cure... it invites.\" Since then, several bodies have been found around the old Biogenyx station, with their bones turned inside out, hearts beating in their eyes, and each of them smiling. Always smiling. Final note: If someone offers the Enoch Project formula… refuse. It's not the life he offers. It is the eternal consciousness in decomposition.",

      "content": "“I am the Witness. I see the pattern beyond the plan. I see their goal. Their smiles. And the angel approaches.\" President Eric Potentia arrived at doctor. Evelyn Harrow’s quarters long after the order had been sent for her to return. But the apartment was empty. Not abandoned—prepared. On her desk sat a letter, not addressed to him. It spoke in a cold, ritualistic tone, promising “ascension under the scarlet sky” and requesting a meeting at Sally’s Bar, Dockside District, midnight. No name. Just a symbol—a smile. Eric showed the letter to Reyes. “She didn’t expect me to find this,” he said. “This was for someone else.” The bar was silent. No music, no lights, just the faint buzz of a neon beer sign dying in the window. The only sign of recent life was a half-smoked cigarette still warm in an ashtray. Eric swept the place. Empty. Until he stepped outside. A figure, coat drawn tight, walked away into the misted streets. Something about them stirred suspicion, but nothing concrete. Eric started to turn back, and then the sign above the closed hotel across the street flickered violently. The Sleeping Madman. The neon glitched. Letters blinked in and out until it briefly read: THE M Eric froze. The Moon’s warning echoed in his head, \"The Sun will guide you.\" Now the Sun was answering—guiding him. He gave chase. Eric caught the figure near a stairwell. “Stop!” he shouted. The figure turned—young, mid-twenties, confused but alert. “I don’t know anything,” they said. “She just said ‘Site-0.’ Said everything would change there.” Eric’s blood turned to ice. Only he and the highest-ranking trusted individuals were cleared for Site-0, Evelyn not one of them. Site-0 was the President's central command and experimental operations facility, a high-tech complex built above ground into the rocky desert cliffs. It was where the most dangerous knowledge was stored—where the original Ouija Experiment chamber was preserved in secret. No unauthorized person had ever stepped foot inside, until now. Eric brought Reyes with him. But they weren’t the first to arrive. The Mothman floated silently in the sky above the site. They pushed inside—alarms blaring silently, overridden. Corpses of guards lay sprawled in pools of crimson. Cultists were waiting. They wore yellow smiling masks. Some fought. Some didn’t. Some smiled as they died. They made it to the main control room, and there she was. Evelyn Harrow turned slowly as they entered, her hands hovering inches above the glowing touchscreen. The display warped beneath her fingers like liquid glass, reacting without contact. “Evelyn,” Eric said, raising his weapon. “You don’t have to do this. You’ll trigger the global failsafe. The nukes will fall.” She smiled. “Yes, I K̸̩̍ͅN̶̦̱͐O̴̳͇̊W̷͂͜.” Reyes moved forward. A blade pierced his chest. He died before he hit the ground. Cultists dragged Eric to his knees. Evelyn touched the screen without touching it—and the world cracked. Alarms shrieked across monitors. Missile silos unlocked. Launch codes executed. Cities. Research sites. Russia. She explained it calmly “Russia has the largest arsenal. And the most to lose. We will bring the world to it's knees, so the void can destroy the aftermath.” Eric screamed. “You’re mad!” “No,” she said, “I am J̷̢̈́O̴̝͌Y̶͓̔.” Aiden Shaw burst in—gun blazing. Cultists fell. Eric broke free. He shot the control panel—shattering it. Then fired at her. Her hand came off. She screamed—but not in pain, in joy. Her hand came back skinless, nails sharp. Skinless wings sprouted from her back. A sideways maw consumes her fake face, her true face now revealed. She impaled Shaw with a single strike. Eric fled. He ran through halls. Took down cultists. Reached the Incineration Chamber—used for chemical disposal in worst-case outbreaks. She followed. “I have worn many faces,” she roared, voice booming through steel. “Gouverneur Morris. Susanna Hartley. I was there when they accused witch. I was laughter before language.” Eric ducked under her claws. He fired at the gas valve and threw his now lit lighter. The room burst into flame. She screamed, engulfed in fire, still laughing. Eric turned. Ran. She chased, ablaze, wings snapping through steel beams. “I am the Crimson Mother!” she yelled. “The Laughing Priestess! The Smiling Angel! THE VOIDRA!” Eric shot the ceiling. It caved in. The last thing he saw was her hand, reaching through the fire—melting, reforming. Then silence. He stumbled outside. The Mothman retreated into the sky. Eric called in the emergency line. A helicopter lifted him into the sky. Below, Site-0 burned.",

      "title": "Someone removed my car’s wipers and threw them at my feet in a store hours later",
      "content": "This was a truly strange event that happened to me recently. One morning, I left my house to go to the supermarket. It was a Saturday, and I needed to do some grocery shopping. I have a regular job that requires me to work in the office five days a week. As far as I knew, that week and the previous Friday had been completely ordinary. I park my car on the street in front of my house because I don't have a private parking lot. There's an alley and a small separate garage behind the house, but I always find it easier to park in the front. Most people in the neighborhood do the same. That morning, I left the house and walked toward my car. I didn’t notice anything unusual until I sat in the car. When I got into the car, I realized that the windshield wipers were missing. It was a sunny day, but it had rained a bit the night before, and the car had been parked under a tree, so there was some water on the windshield. I wanted to use the wipers, but they weren’t there. I thought maybe some local troublemakers had taken them. I looked at the other cars on the street, and their wipers were still in place. So, this wasn’t a random attack; it was targeted at me. I didn’t know who had done it, but I realized I needed to buy new wipers. Before heading to the supermarket, I stopped by a place I knew. I parked the car and went inside. Since it was early in the morning, the store was quiet. I found the right aisle and started looking for wipers that would fit my car. I spent a few minutes there, examining the wipers. At that moment, I heard someone entering the store and walking toward me, but I didn’t pay much attention at first. It was a woman. She had wipers in her hands. Then she threw the wipers down and quickly left the store. But why? I didn’t know her, and I had no idea who she was. I picked up the wipers from the floor, and yes, they were definitely mine. I walked out to the front of the store, but the woman was gone. Then, I heard a car starting, and I looked over at the window. It was a white sedan, leaving the parking lot. The cashier saw me looking outside and asked, \"Is this about a girl problem?\" He thought she was my ex-girlfriend and seemed to find it quite amusing. I bought the new wipers, and after the cashier installed them on my car, I continued with my shopping. Throughout the day, I kept thinking about why that woman had done that. Maybe I had irritated her while driving home the day before. I commute during rush hours, and there are a lot of people on the road. But I’m a good driver. Maybe she felt that way, but I don’t remember. Still, how did she find me here? Did she follow me the day before and wait all night? It’s a wild thought, but somehow, she had found me.

      "title": "The Cartoon That Killed My Best Friend",
      "content": "There’s a cartoon episode that aired once and was almost immediately banned. But rumor has it, if you watch it alone after midnight, something follows you. Follows you... and eventually kills you. That's what they say at least. And I believe them. I believe them because of what happened to my best friend, David. David was the kind of person everyone wanted to be around. He had this way of making people laugh without trying, like when he attempted to convince our math teacher that his calculator was haunted, just to get out of a pop quiz. He was kind, easy to talk to, and somehow always knew when someone needed cheering up. People loved him for that. But to me, he wasn’t just the funny, likable kid everyone admired, he was my best friend since we were five years old. We started kindergarten together, and we have been inseparable ever since. He was always the one person I felt completely safe with. Closer than a brother. At around the age of 12, we got hooked on horror and especially creepypastas. We would waste away hours on Reddit and YouTube, consuming all the scary stories and legends that we could find. Then it happened. I was in my room, lost in a World of Warcraft dungeon, when David burst in, breathless and grinning as if he just won the lottery. He told me about a creepypasta that he had just read. It was about a cartoon that was released in 1966... and then vanished. It was a strange black-and-white cartoon about a cat endlessly chased by its own shadow. No matter where it ran, across rooftops, through alleys, or into silent moonlit fields, the shadow was always just a step behind. The animation got more distorted as it went on, the lines trembling as if the reel itself was somehow afraid. In the final scene, the cat stops running. The shadow catches up… and wraps around it like smoke. Then, without a sound, the fur begins to peel away. Slowly. Deliberately. And just before the screen cuts to black, a low, crackling voice whispers something. Three words that sound like ancient static: “Omni hexxus satanis.” David told me that he found the cartoon on the Dark Web and watched it. He was thrilled at the thought of testing out a creepypasta in real life. Of course, I feigned excitement. But deep down, I was terrified for him. All I could think about was the warning: Watch it, and something will stalk you. And eventually, it will kill you. That was 10 years ago, though it feels like yesterday. I can still barely believe the events that followed. A few days after he watched it, David started acting... different. He kept glancing over his shoulder. He flinched at shadows. He looked tired, like something was draining him from the inside out. Eventually, he told me what was going on. He said he was seeing things - movement out of the corners of his eyes. He felt like he was being watched, followed. He kept getting phone calls where no one spoke. Just silence... then a click. And worst of all, the TV in his room started turning on by itself. Always at 3 a.m. Always playing nothing but white noise. He swore he could hear his name in the static. Then it happened... One day I went to school and David wasn't there. I found it weird because he never skipped. I assumed maybe he was sick or something. Then, after school, I went home, and my parents told me that David was missing. When his parents went into his room to wake him up that morning, he wasn't there. His bed was empty. I had a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. I knew something was wrong, deeply wrong. Tragically chilling. Then my worst fears were realized. Three days later, the police found what was left of him in the woods behind his house. He was skinned. All I could think, besides the unbearable thought that I'd lost my best friend forever, was that he died just like the cat in that cursed cartoon. It’s been ten years since David died. Since they found him in the woods like something out of a nightmare. I wish I could say I moved on. That time dulled the memories. But the truth is, it never let me go. I stopped sleeping with the lights off. I still can’t walk past shadows without glancing twice. For years, I avoided cursed media altogether. No creepypastas. No late-night horror binges. Just the thought of them made my skin crawl. But curiosity is a strange thing. It gnaws at you in silence, especially when there are questions left unanswered. A few weeks ago, I started searching again. Not for fun. For closure. For proof. I went deeper than I ever had before. Old Reddit threads long since forgotten, archived forums, fragments of.onion links buried in dead blogs. And then… I found it. The cartoon. HIS cartoon. I don’t know why I clicked play. Maybe part of me needed to know if it was real. Maybe I needed to believe he didn’t die for nothing. I watched it. And now... Wait. Something just moved in the corner of my eye. No. Not something. Someone.",

      "title": "The Room That Wasn’t on the Blueprint",
      "content": "My wife and I bought an old farmhouse last spring. You know the type—paint peeling like sunburned skin, a creaky porch, and wallpaper older than the moon landing. We got it cheap, too, which should’ve been a red flag. But we were eager. First-time homeowners, ready to “restore some charm,” as my wife liked to say. The place had character, sure. But it also had something else. The blueprint we got from the town records showed the house had four bedrooms, two baths, a kitchen, and a basement. Standard. We verified it when we did the initial walkthrough. But three weeks after moving in, we found the fifth door. It was behind a bookcase in the upstairs hallway. The shelf was screwed into the wall, but badly. One day, I leaned on it while hanging a picture and felt it shift. Curiosity got the best of me. I unscrewed the shelf, dragged it away, and revealed a perfectly normal-looking white door, complete with an old brass knob. We were both confused. This door wasn’t on any blueprint. Not on the inspection reports. Not even visible from the outside of the house. From the lawn, the area behind it looked like empty wall space between two rooms. So naturally, we opened it. The room was small. Maybe 8x8 feet. No windows. Just faded green wallpaper and a single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. It smelled like dust and damp wood. But here’s the weird part: it was warm. Almost…humid. There was nothing inside except for a rocking chair in the middle of the room. An antique, maybe oak. And on the seat was a cassette tape. No player, just the tape. The label on it read, in smudged pen: “PLAY ME. ALONE.” My wife, being rational, wanted to throw it away. “It’s probably some prank,” she said. “Or worse—some creep lived here and left us a message.” But I couldn’t stop thinking about it. That night, while she slept, I dug my old Walkman out of a box in the garage and sat in the mysterious room. The walls felt like they were pressing in as I clicked “Play.” Static. Then a voice. Low. Raspy. “Do not look at it.” That’s all. Then silence. The tape ended. What was “it”? I rewound it and played it again. Same thing. “Do not look at it.” I barely slept that night. My dreams were full of that voice. By morning, I convinced myself it was some weird art project. Maybe a college kid lived here before us and was trying to be edgy. But things got worse after the tape. We started hearing knocking. Always at 3:03 a.m. Sharp. Three knocks. Then silence. At first, we thought it was the pipes. But it always came from the hidden room. Then came the dreams. Both of us started waking up screaming. My wife dreamed about a man with no face standing at the foot of our bed, slowly raising a finger to his lips. Shhh. I dreamed of the room. Except it wasn’t empty anymore. Something was sitting in the rocking chair. Watching me. But when I turned to look, I’d wake up in a cold sweat. One night, the knocking came again. This time, I was done pretending it was nothing. I grabbed a flashlight and marched to the room. I don’t know what I was thinking. Bravery? Stupidity? The room was empty. But the chair was rocking. Not like a breeze had nudged it. It was moving like someone had just gotten up from it. I slammed the door shut. That should’ve been it. But I couldn’t let it go. Something about that voice haunted me. So the next night, I did the one thing I was told not to do. I looked. I set up a camera in the corner of the room. Pointed at the chair. Let it record overnight. When I checked the footage the next day, my heart dropped. Around 3:03 a.m., the lightbulb began to flicker. Then the chair started to rock. Slowly. Then—frame by frame—something appeared. It started as a shadow. Then legs. Arms. A torso. Finally, a head. Sitting in the chair was a figure, pitch black, like it had sucked in all the light around it. Then, the worst part. It turned to look directly at the camera. And smiled. Not a normal smile. Too wide. Too many teeth. The tape cut out after that. Static filled the screen. I showed my wife. She cried. We called a priest, who took one look at the footage and flat-out refused to step inside the house. We moved out a week later. Didn’t even sell the place—just left. Took the loss. Sometimes, late at night, I still hear the knocking. Always at 3:03 a.m. Three knocks. Then silence. I haven’t played the tape since. I keep it locked in a box in the attic of our new place, wrapped in towels and duct tape. But last night, when I went to check the box, the tape was gone. In its place was a single scrap of paper, written in the same smudged pen as before: You looked. Now it sees you.",

      "content": "Hello, my name is Noah, and I have a story I have kept secret for years that I want to share with the public. Back in 2001, something tragic happened. I was staying in a house with my family, everything seemed normal until I noticed there were lots of rabbits in our backyard. We had seen some rabbits before, but this time they all seemed to want to get inside. Because they were wild animals, we didn't let them in, so I went to bed not thinking anything of it, but little did I know what would take place that night. I woke up around 2 AM to hear screaming. I opened the door to see what was happening, and I wish I hadn't. Outside, there were two bodies, they appeared to have been fatally stabbed multiple times, but the worst part was what was standing over them. Standing over my parents' bodies was a human-looking creature, but it had a rabbit head in place of a normal head, it was wearing all white, and its eyes looked like they had been torn out, as well as holding a knife. It slowly turned to me and charged. I screamed and grabbed a camera, and took a picture before breaking my window and jumping out. The creature didn't seem to want to leave my parents' house; it looked at me and turned back. I don't know what happened that day, I have the picture I was able to capture at rougerabbit\\recovered\\picture19 - Imgur After some further research on this thing, it appears as though this creature has been encountered before. Signs of it appearing include: Rabbits (More than usual if you have some living near you) in your backyard, seeming to want to get in. Seeing blood around your house, as well as mysterious notes saying \"I Will Kill You,\" I did not experience anything other than rabbits wanting to get in, but if you experience any of these, then be prepared. \\-Noah",

      "content": "I believe everyone has something they’re scared of. Clowns, bugs, colors. Yes, colors. Ask my uncle Nick—he’s terrified of pink. A grown man paralyzed by the sight of bubblegum. Once, at a niece’s birthday party, he passed out cold just because the clown handed him a bouquet of pink balloons. The brain is funny like that—so fragile, so precise in its irrationality. Me? I have Haphephobia. The fear of being touched. Go ahead, laugh. Most people do at first. Until they try to shake my hand and I flinch like they’ve pulled a knife. Until they see me panic when someone brushes past me in a crowd. It’s not a quirk. It’s not a preference. It’s a condition. “How do you function in society?” they ask. I manage. I keep to myself. The people around me know the rules—don’t touch me. Don’t get close. My home is my sanctuary, the one place I’m in control. But you know what’s funny? We live in a world where “no” doesn’t always mean “no.” Where boundaries are suggestions, not laws. Especially with men. Not all men, sure—but enough. Enough that I stopped feeling safe a long time ago. Enough that I learned how to disappear in plain sight. And lucky for me, my job allows for that. I work in home security. Not the kind where I come to your house and install a camera. No. I manage remote access systems. I monitor home feeds, patch firmware vulnerabilities, override alarms when the owners lock themselves out. I see everything. I know everything. And most importantly? I watch. Do you know how easy it is to see someone for who they really are when they think they’re alone? You wouldn’t believe the things people do in their “safe spaces.” The things they hide from even themselves. Over time, I started becoming… curious. About fear. See, it started with a break-in. A client’s daughter got locked in the bathroom during a home invasion. The footage showed her screaming, shaking, losing control. She was terrified—not of the intruder—but of the dark. Classic Nyctophobia. Something about the total absence of light paralyzed her more than the threat itself. It stayed with me. I wanted to understand more. How fear grips people. So I began researching phobias. At first, clinically. Articles. Videos. But that wasn’t enough. I wanted to see it. I wanted to feel it. Real fear. Raw. Unfiltered. That’s when I met Suzy. We talked online. Shared memes. Trauma. She thought I was just another shut-in with social anxiety. She told me her younger sister had an extreme fear of frogs. Ranidaphobia. Even seeing one on a screen made her gag. Apparently, when they were kids, a cousin locked her in a greenhouse with a few bullfrogs and she fainted. It stuck. I asked questions. I took notes. Then, I made a plan. Suzy didn’t know it, of course. But her sister—Aly—was going to help me understand fear. I watched their home for weeks. Studied the layout. Their habits. The way Aly took the trash out barefoot at midnight. The way she always propped the door open with a brick. No alarms. No cameras. A perfect test site. One night, I waited. Knocked her out when she came back in. Quick. Quiet. She didn’t even see my face. She woke up in a basement filled with frogs. Tiny ones. Fat ones. Vibrant green, warty brown, even those translucent albino kinds that look like ghost skin. I covered the floor, the shelves, even the ceiling rafters. The walls were soundproofed. The door was sealed. She screamed so loud it vibrated the camera feed. The footage was beautiful. She clawed at her skin. Tried to climb the walls. At one point, she tried to eat one, just to end it. But the best part? She texted Suzy. I must’ve missed her phone in the panic. Suzy started blowing up my DMs. “My sister’s gone.” “She says she’s trapped.” “She says there are frogs.” I told her I’d help. Told her I’d check their home security. I acted concerned. And Suzy, sweet naive Suzy, gave me her address. I brought flowers. Said I was from the company. Now she’s in the basement too. I let Aly go. Gave her a sedative. Dropped her near a hospital. She won’t talk. They never do. Who would believe her? A room of frogs? She’ll get institutionalized at best. But Suzy? She’s been more… resistant. Last night, she started talking. Whispering, actually. Said she figured it out. Said she knows who I am. So I took her eyes. It’s hard to see fear when you have no eyes. But you can still feel it. Especially when your hearing sharpens. She can hear the frogs. She can feel them hop across her skin. She can smell them. She won’t be a long-term subject. But she’ll serve her purpose. Now I’m looking for the next one. You seem interested. You’ve read this far, haven’t you? So tell me… What’s your phobia? Don’t worry. I’ll find out eventually.",

      "content": "A few months ago, I was invited to a wedding in a faraway place. The plane tickets were quite expensive, so I decided to take a road trip instead. Additionally, there were a few places along the way that I wanted to see. On the first morning of the trip, I left early and spent most of the day in the car. However, I did stop at a few places to explore. Because of that, I continued driving at night. I was really tired, so I decided to look for a hotel. I got off the highway and started searching for a gas station to refuel. I drove about 5 miles on a quiet road. Just as I was starting to think about turning back, I saw a gas station sign ahead. I turned left and noticed a small gas station in the distance. It was a very small station, and there was hardly any settlement around. After finishing my business, I checked my phone, but there was no signal. I looked at the closed building part of the station, but there was no one inside. There were no other cars or open stores in the area. I left the gas station and retraced my path, turning right. But this road didn’t seem familiar. Maybe I had turned at the wrong spot, or I had missed the main turn. The sky was very dark by now, and since there was no signal on my phone, the map was useless. As I went a little further, I saw a sign for the exit I was looking for. I felt relieved and turned that way. But this time, there was a warning sign and a truck with flashing lights in front of me. There was roadwork being done, so I had to turn another way. This was annoying because I didn’t know how long I’d be delayed, but at least I was heading in the right direction. I continued on the road, but soon another detour sign appeared. After driving for about a minute, the road suddenly ended. It was as if the road just stopped, and there was only forest ahead. I stopped the car and checked my phone again. Still no signal. A bad feeling started to creep over me. At that moment, a group of people started emerging from the forest. They looked like they were carrying weapons. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I floored the gas pedal and quickly drove away from there. While driving, I heard someone trying to open the back driver’s side door. When I looked in the mirror, I saw someone running after the car, trying to open the door. Luckily, I managed to escape. I tried to remember the roads I had come from as I turned around and headed back. When I reached the first detour sign, I noticed that it was no longer there. I kept driving and eventually found the gas station I had stopped at earlier. After that, I started trying some other roads. Throughout the night, I didn’t see another car. Eventually, I managed to get back to the highway. After a while, my phone picked up a signal again, and I found a hotel where I stayed for the night. I hope I never experience anything like that again. Check out more True Car Driving Horror Stories",

      "content": "Part 1: I was frozen in time. I couldn’t move. What was happening? I nearly had a heart attack when I heard my phone ring. It was a number I didn’t recognize. I held the phone up to my ear. Silence. “Hello?” I said. On the other end of the phone there were no words spoken, just heavy breathing. I quickly hung up. I barely had time to lower the phone when I heard a whisper, inches from my ear. “Don’t move.” The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I turned around to find nothing. No one was there. I had to get out of here. I needed my car keys. I had to somehow work up the courage to enter the nightmare scenario that was my “house”. I knew I shouldn’t go back in the house. Everything in my body told me to leave and don’t look back. I wish I had listened to that gut feeling. I opened the door and ran straight for the kitchen, grabbed my car keys and headed back to the front door. I nearly made it out before I stopped dead in my tracks. I heard the TV turn on. I turned around. I’m not sure what compelled me to walk back into the living room but I did. There was another video playing. The timestamp in the bottom right corner was from last week. It was my bed room. The footage wasn’t a stationary shot. It looked like someone was holding the camera. Whoever or whatever was holding the camera lowered its point of view. The camera made its way underneath my bed. Then I heard the bedroom door open. I saw my work boots. Whoever was behind the camera was under my bed, recording me. The video began to fast forward. It began to play again after 15 minutes had elapsed in the video. The camera began moving slowly from beneath the bed. It finally had made its way out. The camera turned and stopped when it reached the foot of the bed. It panned up to me, sleeping. Unknowing. As I laid there motionless a whisper could be heard from a now familiar voice. “Soon.” The screen went black. I stood there in shock. Rooted to the floor. I couldn’t think straight. I turned, ready to run for the door. I didn’t even move one step before I heard a scraping on the floor above me. It sounded like someone rearranging furniture. Then darkness and silence. The lights were no longer on. I could only hear the sound of my own breathing. I involuntarily stopped. Now more scared than I had ever been. I stood there unable to move, frozen with fear. Footsteps began barreling toward me down the stairs leaving me no time to react. I felt a presence. The air heavy now. I felt something right in front of me. Nothing visible. Just a feeling. A knock at the door. All the lights turned back on. I sprinted straight ahead, ready to escape. My hand grabbed the knob and yanked it open with such ferocity the door nearly came off the hinges. The mailman stood on the porch, package in hand. With a bewildered look on his face he handed me the package. It was light, no return address on it. I ripped open the small box. Inside was a single unlabeled USB.",

      "content": "A lot of people need to have alcohol and drugs to have fun, lots of people need alcohol to socialise. It's crazy how every human needs a certain vice to help them connect with other people. It's an ice breaker and I guess alcohol and drugs break down nerves, and it allows the risk taking animalistic behaviour to come through. Most people dread the idea of going to a place of socialising, without any drugs or alcohol. To most people parties don't make sense without alcohol and drugs. I'm here to show people that you don't need alcohol and drugs to socialise and have fun. A group of people wanted to know how to have fun without alcohol and drugs, and I am here to show them how. It's going to be a group thing and they followed me around an area where it's known for parties, alcohol and drugs. I purposely took them here and they all felt weird not drinking alcohol and not taking drugs, on a day where most people do. They didn't believe that they could have fun without alcohol and especially when others were having fun with alcohol and drugs. I smiled at all of them and I knew that I was going to change their lives. Then I introduced them to micky and micky loved to have his trouser zips down. I started telling micky in front of the whole group about how his zippers are undone and that he should zip them up. Micky got annoyed and he said to me \"I like having my zips down\" but I kept telling micky that he should close his zippers. Micky was really starting to get angry with me and he told me again \"I like having my zippers down\" and we were both staring at each other like we were going to fight. Then as micky walked away with his zippers still undone, I walked up to him really fast and I zipped his zippers. Micky was angry at what I had done to him and he felt disrespected. Then micky smiled and calmly told me \"so you have this obsession with zipping up zippers\" Mickey then up to my group and he got out a large stapler, and he started to staple shut people's eyes, mouths, ears, ass holes, vaginas and penis's. Micky then said to me \"you don't like zippers being open well these are the things I don't like being open\" and he pointed at my group who were in pain. The group didn't understand how this was fun but then I explained to them, that this is how I have fun without alcohol and drugs.",

      "content": "“Daniel’s Last Snap” They were just messing around. Daniel, Josh, and Devan had this tradition: every Friday night they’d meet up, drink a little, joke around, and dare each other to do dumb things. It was harmless — until the night at the abandoned aquarium. The place had been shut down for years after a mysterious power outage fried every system and left hundreds of exotic fish dead. No one talked about it anymore. The place stank of mildew and salt, with shattered glass tanks and faded posters of sea life that no longer existed. It was Devan’s idea to break in. “Let’s find something creepy and post it — like old school internet horror.” They didn’t expect the tanks to still have water in them. Or fish. In the darkest part of the aquarium, they found a single tank humming with blue light. Inside, a single, oily black fish floated motionless. It didn’t look natural — more like a shadow shaped like a fish, with eyes that didn’t blink. Josh dared Daniel to reach in and grab it. Of course he did. Daniel laughed and said, “This is gonna break the internet,” as he pulled the thing from the water. Devan snapped a photo, the flash catching Daniel’s manic grin, the slick fish writhing in his hand. He sent it to Snapchat with a stupid caption: “This is a cursed image, like in 10 seconds or die.” That was the last time they saw Daniel. His scream came first. Not like he was in pain — more like he was being unmade. The fish dropped to the floor, and the blue lights flickered. When they turned back to him, Daniel was gone. Just… gone. His phone was still recording. In the background, barely visible through the fish tank glass, something moved. They ran. Josh and Devan swore they’d never talk about it again. But the photo kept resurfacing. People on their contact lists started getting it — even ones they didn’t remember adding. Each time it was clearer, sharper. Daniel’s face started to change in it. His eyes were wider. His mouth stretched inhumanly. And there was always the same caption: “This is a cursed image, like in 10 seconds or die.” Then the disappearances began. Josh vanished on a Monday. Devan tried to delete every file he had. Smashed his phone. Burned the SD cards. Didn’t matter. The image showed up on his bathroom mirror that night, drawn in condensation: 10 seconds. They found him curled in a ball by his tub, eyes wide open, face frozen in silent terror. The authorities called it a breakdown. But we know better. Now the image is online. People repost it for laughs. If you see it, don’t save it. Don’t screenshot. Don’t share. And whatever you do, don’t touch the fish.",

The bell rang late—missus. Paddles always did drag out class with her endless stories—and by the time Debbie and I rushed outside, the last school bus was already pulling away from the curb. We waved. It didn’t stop. “No big deal,” Debbie said, swinging her backpack over her shoulder. “Let’s just walk.” Normally, walking home through the inner city wasn’t our first choice. The neighborhood had a rep—sirens weren’t rare, gunshots weren’t surprising, and posters of missing teens faded slowly on telephone poles. But we were 16, cocky, and convinced we could handle anything. We were two tough girls from the block. No one messed with us. As we hit the corner store on Vine and Howard, Debbie grabbed chips and juice for the next day. I checked my phone. Mom. “Where are you?” she snapped. “Don’t tell me you’re walking.” “We missed the bus,” I said. “Class let out late. We’re together. We’ll be fine.” “You better not be walking,” she warned. “This is how kids go missing. I’m coming now.” Fifteen minutes later, Mom pulled up, still fussing. I rolled my eyes, but deep down I knew she meant well. She hated this neighborhood and made sure we knew it. Back home, she was halfway into cooking when the pot boiled over. She left the stove to flip on the news—just for a second. The image on the screen froze us all. “BREAKING: High School Bus Missing – 13 Students Unaccounted For” I felt my stomach drop. The newscaster’s voice was steady but grim. “A school bus carrying 13 students from James E. Thomas High disappeared this afternoon. It was last seen turning off Route 7 near the old shipping yards. No signs of the driver or children have been found.” Photos of my classmates—some who sat next to me in class—flashed on the screen. Smiling faces. Names I knew. One of them had borrowed a pencil from me today. The camera cut to the school. Helicopters. FBI jackets. Mothers collapsing on the sidewalk. I looked at Debbie. She was pale. “The bus…” I whispered. “It drove off just as we stepped outside.” Debbie slowly nodded. “If we were even thirty seconds earlier…” missus. Paddles’ long-winded lesson saved us. That was the only reason we weren’t on that bus. And as the screen faded into a reporter’s somber face, a realization struck me that turned my bones to ice: The bus didn’t stop for us. It saw us. And it left us behind. On purpose.",

      "content": "Harry got a teaching position at some special type of adult school and it was a really high paying job. It had adult students who were exactly the same as other adult students in other schools, so harry couldn't understand the high salary. It was a school for adults that wanted to be educated. Then when harry looked at the curriculum at what he had to teach these adults, he was confused. He had to basically teach these adults how to pour water into a cup. Harry was confused but hey he was getting paid for it. The easiest highest paying job harry ever had. Harry first day of teaching adult class and seeing all of the adults, he definitely prefered adults to teenagers. Harry remembered getting a cup out of the cupboard and turning on the tap water, and then pouring it into a cup. All of the adults in the class were in such awe at what harry was doing. They couldn't believe how harry was pouring the water into the cup, and they kept telling harry to redo it. Some were even recording harry on their phones, and all of the adult students were super excited by thr pouring of water into the cup. Harry then got the attention of a female adult student called mellissa, and she was in her early twenties. They started dating and Harry became so popular with the other adult students as well, all he ever did was pour water into a cup. Harry didn't understand it but he was loving life. When Melissa then introduced Harry to her mother, Harry also hit it off with the mother. Melissa's mother was also super excited by the videos of Harry pouring water into a cup. Melissa and her mother wanted to enter an open relationship with Harry, and Harry agreed. So now Harry was in a relationship with Melissa and her mother. It was going well until things started to go down hill. One day in class Harry poured water into a cup, the whole were so super excited by this, that some of the students minds couldn't handle it. Some of the adults in the class, their heads literally burst into a bloody mess including Melissa's. Harry couldn't believe it and Harry got criticism from the managers, the criticism were about what Harry was teaching and being so hard that minds couldn't take it. Harry replied back to all of the criticisms that what he was teaching wasn't hard, pouring water into a cup isn't hard. Then Harry's relationship with Melissa's mother became strained, because Melissa's mother blamed him for the death of her daughter.",

      "title": "My Driving Lesson Ended with a Car Following Us And a Gun",
      "content": "This event happened in August 2015. At that time, I was 18 years old and preparing for my driving test. A few months earlier, I had applied for a driver’s license and was taking driving lessons. As far as I remember, the person who was teaching me had a private car; this car also had a brake on the passenger side. During the second lesson, I drove more in the city. Our last lesson was a mix of everything, focusing mostly on parking. I don’t remember the instructor’s name, but he was a really good person; relaxed, calm, and a great teacher. The lesson started around 4 p.m. We drove on a few different roads and went over some things. I don’t remember too many details, but by around 6 p.m., the sun had started setting, and it was getting dark. Then, we went to a parking lot. The instructor told me to park the car, and then he got out and took out some cheap, small orange cones. He placed them like parking lines. He then got back in the car, and we started the parking exercise. The area wasn’t very big, but there was enough space to practice. While I was starting the parking exercise, a car came from the road and entered the same parking lot. I didn’t pay much attention to it because it came from the other end of the lot. The car parked at a distant spot. I continued with my parking practice and didn’t focus on that car. No one got out of it, and it stayed there. A few minutes later, another car arrived. It parked near the first car but a little closer to us. The instructor muttered something like, “I wonder what these people are doing here.” It was strange for people to park in a lot like this at that hour. We had specifically come here because I thought it would be empty, at least that’s what I assumed. Still, I focused on my parking. I thought parking would be the hardest part for me. At that moment, one of the cars that had arrived earlier suddenly started backing up. At first, I thought it was just passing by, but after I had parked, the car came right behind us and stopped just a few meters away. It stayed there for about a minute, not moving at all. The instructor told me to stay in the car while he tried to figure out what was going on. I didn’t look at him, just stared ahead and waited for him to return. Suddenly, my instructor came back unexpectedly and quickly. He was in a panic and immediately told me to leave the parking lot. I told him we hadn’t picked up the cones, but he said it didn’t matter. It was clear he was nervous. I started the car and we drove out of the parking lot. The car behind us followed us out. The instructor told me not to panic. When he got close to the vehicle, he noticed a gun and quickly returned to our car. At that moment, the other car also started following us. The instructor told me to drive to the nearest police station, not to speed, and to stay calm. It took us about 10 minutes to get to the police station, but it felt like hours. Both cars followed us along the way but didn’t overtake us or do anything else. Finally, when we reached the police station, I drove the car inside, and they continued on their way. I parked the car, and we went inside to report the incident. I was so happy to have made it out safely. I passed the driving test on my first try, but I’ll never forget this experience.

      "title": "The Beast of Gevaudan: The Return of Evil",
      "content": "In the mid-18th century, France was marked by a series of horrific murders that continue to haunt history to this day. The Beast of Gevaudan, an unknown and bloodthirsty creature, was responsible for a trail of violent deaths in an isolated region, amid the dark forests of Gevaudan. However, what many don't know is that she was never truly defeated. The beast is still among us. And, in the dead of night, she returns. It all started in 1764, when the first attacks occurred. At first it was seen as just a beast, perhaps a direwolf, but it soon became clear that its nature was much darker. Its victims were found torn to pieces, with the flesh torn from their bones, as if the creature fed on something other than mere flesh. His eyes were described as human eyes, red and piercing, illuminated by the light of the full moon. However, the true nature of the beast was never understood. Over the years, many hunters have tried to capture or kill the creature, but they have all failed, disappearing without a trace. Fear spread quickly, but the beast seemed to revel in it, as if it knew that no one would be able to stop its insatiable hunger. Today, in the 21st century, the myth of the Beast of Gevaudan was just another scary story to tell on stormy nights. But the evil never disappeared. He waited. He grew up. It evolved. I was just a teenager when my curiosity about the case of the Beast of Gevaudan led me on a journey to the region of southern France. What I found there, however, was not just a legend. I found hell. It was on a cold night, while walking along one of the many trails hidden in the dense forest, that I saw her. I saw her at her most horrible. It wasn't a wolf. It was something much worse. A monstrous being, with claws that extended more than a meter, teeth as sharp as sawmill knives, and skin covered in a layer of wet black fur that seemed to absorb the moonlight. His eyes were not red as in the old descriptions. No, the beast's eyes were as black as the abyss, and when it looked at me, it was as if I was being consumed from within, as if my soul was being devoured. Before I could react, she attacked. The pain was unbearable. His claws cut into my flesh with the precision of a sharp blade, and the feeling of blood gushing from my veins was like a nightmare experienced in the flesh. She dragged me to the ground, and the last thing I saw was her macabre smile, an expression that was not that of an animal, but of something that understood death and pain in a way no creature should. But I didn't die. Not completely. Something about the beast transformed me. Something about the poison that coursed through my veins caused me to wake up in an even worse nightmare. I woke up in a damp cave, shrouded in shadows, with an insatiable hunger that wasn't mine. My body felt strange, distorted. My claws had grown, my teeth now sharp as those of the beast itself. And the most terrifying thing: my eyes, the same black eyes of the creature, reflected back the horror that it was. Now, I'm the predator. And the hunger never stopped. I hunt in the shadows, hoping more souls will be lost on the forgotten trails. Every death makes me stronger. Every scream feeds me. The Beast of Gevaudan did not die. She just waited. And now, she will never be defeated again. If you are hiking in the forests of Gevaudan, or anywhere in the world, be careful. It's not just a legend. I am always close. I am the Beast. And you, you will be the next victim.",

It looked like a spiral—millions of tiny glowing dots, each with a name. Most were grayed out. One blinked red. Mine. I pinched to zoom in. It showed my apartment, but… slightly off. The furniture was too clean. The fridge had no magnets. A photo on the shelf was of me—but I was older. Smiling. Wearing a suit I don’t own. I blinked. The scene changed. Now I was watching a version of me, in the same apartment, sitting on the floor… crying. Another version. Laughing. With someone I’ve never met. Then hundreds. Thousands. A storm of lives I could’ve lived. A library of me’s. And I was the only one that got the message. I tried calling someone. Anyone. My phone had no service—but one contact remained: \"Operator.\" I called. They answered instantly. A calm, digital voice spoke: \"Congratulations. You are now aware. Awareness disqualifies you from simulation auto-respawn. Please proceed to manual selection.\" I stammered. “What simulation? What do you mean disqualifies?” But the voice just said: \"You were never supposed to wake up.\" The lights exploded. My phone melted in my hand like wax. And the apartment… flickered. Like bad CGI. My bookshelf vanished. My couch turned into a loading bar. And standing in the hallway—was another me. Wearing a suit. Smiling. He raised a finger to his lips and whispered: “Shhh. Go back to sleep. I’ll take it from here.” [End.] Or is it?? Stay tuned..",

      "content": "Letícia and Érico's mission took them to the icy heart of Antarctica, in an abandoned 1970s base called Estação Novelo, built by a secret consortium of South American countries that claimed to study “tectonic anomalies”. What they found buried under tons of ice wasn't just an alien construction. It was a cosmic womb, petrified, the size of an entire city, still pulsing heat. In the station's archives, documents in Portuguese, Spanish and Russian described a project called Espiral Negra: in 1965, seismographs detected “underground beats” that spread in waves throughout South America, coming from a single point — that exact location. Letícia, when analyzing a symbol carved into the organic walls of the uterus, realized that it corresponded to neuronal patterns found in 20-week-old human embryos. It was a genetic code... written in architecture. In the recording of one of the scientists at Estação Novelo, a faint voice said: — They didn't come from outside. They grew up here, inside the Earth, before us. Humanity is just your skin. Meanwhile, the mother creature began to manifest itself in the dreams of survivors around the world. They called it The Root, an ancient mind trapped beneath layers of living rock, which now used human bodies as antennas to rebuild itself. Érico decided to activate the explosive charges in the station's glacial core. Leticia, in an act of desperation, connected to the mother creature's brain filament, trying to reach its consciousness. For three minutes, she saw it all: the birth of The Root in the far reaches of geological time, her hibernation as the Earth formed around her, and her fury as she awakened and realized that the planet had been colonized by sentient parasites—us. Letícia survived. But his eyes never blinked again. Today, she writes in forgotten languages, using the blood of hybrids as ink. And he repeats the same phrase every day: — The flesh is the seed. And the harvest began.",

      "content": "I stopped running. It was clear this thing—whatever it was—didn’t care about distance. I could burn it, bury it, throw it into the ocean. It would always come back. So I changed my strategy. If I couldn’t run, I’d dig. Find the source. Cut it off. The deeper I searched, the more I found people like me—blog posts with missing comment sections, archived forums full of static-laced audio files, all gone now. Scrubbed clean. But a few survivors left a name: “The Kerr Signal.” A frequency embedded in certain audio recordings—inaudible to most humans. But if your brain happens to pick it up? You become tuned. Once you’re tuned, it can reach you anywhere. Only one place kept coming up—a facility in rural Vermont, long-abandoned, once run by a now-defunct research group called Auralyne. Supposedly, they studied “cognitive resonances in anomalous audio environments.” Translation: they were trying to weaponize sound. I drove straight there. The building was more like a bunker. Rusted doors. Cracked windows. Burned-out lights flickering just enough to keep you unsure of what you were seeing. Inside, everything had been gutted—except one room. Soundproofed. Lead-lined. In the center, suspended by wires, was a single recorder. Older than mine. Bulkier. But still active. The screen displayed one message: “Welcome back, Elias.” I stepped into the room, and the door sealed shut behind me. The lights died. The recorder played by itself. The voice on it wasn’t mine, or Elias’s, or anyone I’d heard before. It was everything. A thousand whispers layered into one. Some screamed. Some laughed. Some begged. Then one word came through them all: “Erase.” There was a button on the recorder I hadn’t seen before—covered in dust, hidden under a panel. ERASE MASTER FILE No confirmation prompt. I hit it. Everything shook. The sound wasn’t loud—it was complete silence, like reality took a breath and held it. The lights went white. My ears rang. Blood dripped from my nose. Then—darkness. When I woke up, I was outside. Grass under me. Morning sun overhead. The building? Gone. Like it had never existed. And the recorder? Nowhere. No new files. No voices. No 3:17 AM wake-ups. Just… peace. Or so I thought. Until I got home. On my laptop screen, where I left no open windows, was one file waiting for me. No name. No icon. Just a blinking cursor. And when I clicked it? A waveform appeared. Still recording.",

It's harder than it looks to make sure that a restaurant isn't busy, my waiters do their best but it doesn't always happen. When I walk in and see that my restaurant is full of people that are eating the food, I become angry. I shout at my waiters for failing in their job. My waiters then reply back to me by saying that it's a good thing that a restaurant is busy. I cannot make them understand why my restaurant can never be busy. When I see my restaurant full of people that are eating whole cooked cows, sheep and other animals that can also still have a conversation with the customers. That's why people love to come to my restaurant, because they can have conversations with the cooked animal that they are eating. I hear all sorts of conversations and this is why I don't want my restaurant to be busy at all. I want my restaurant to be empty and my waiters all know what I want from them. If I even just see 1 customer in my restaurant, I become angry. I hear all sorts of conversations between a cooked animal and the customer eating them. Sometimes it could be joyful and full of happiness, and other times it could lead to an argument. If the conversation between the cooked animal and the customer was not a good one, then the customer would demand a refund. One customer started to tear up the cooked animal we had given him because the conversation was not the one he wanted. He didn't want to pay for it but in the end we made him pay for it. So I am constantly shouting at my employees for not doing enough to deter customers coming into my restaurant. It's a daily battle. Then one day I cone into the kitchen and it's busy with people again and I shout at my waiters for allowing it to get busy. Then when I go into my kitchen, my head chef is having a wonderful conversation with his wife. This confused me because I know that this chefs wife hasn't been on speaking terms with him for a good while. There are even divorce rumours flying about him and his wife. So when I saw him having a lovely conversation with her in the restaurant kitchen? I realised that he had cooked her.",

      "content": "As the world watched Brazil's collapse with fearful eyes and tied hands, a group of survivors emerged from the ruins of the Dead Zone — a region now completely covered in pulsating organic structures, where the ground bleeds and the sky appears darker. This group called itself Linha Zero. Led by retired sergeant Érico Vale and biologist Letícia Amaral, they discovered something extraordinary in one of the contaminated caves near the border with Uruguay: a dead alien body — the first record of one being inert. Inside the translucent skull, they found a pulsating but damaged nucleus. Letícia managed to extract an organic-metallic filament and injected it into a laboratory mouse. The animal had convulsions... but survived. For 72 hours, the rat learned to navigate a complex maze it had never seen before, demonstrating abnormal intelligence. But the next night, he gouged out his own eyes with his paws and died. Letícia concluded that the alien organism was not just assimilating, but installing something — a type of collective consciousness that humans were unable to sustain. But there was hope: during the assimilation process, between conversion stages, the human brain still maintained consciousness for up to 23 minutes. This “transition time” was key. Linha Zero began hunting and capturing hybrids at an early stage, extracting information from them through induced brain waves — images, names, tunnel maps and a central command pattern: a mother organism, located somewhere between southern Brazil and Antarctica. Abroad, borders began to collapse. In Buenos Aires, the basement of a hospital collapsed, revealing veins of meat and organic threads identical to Brazilian ones. In the Atacama Desert, tourists recorded lights coming from the ground, not the sky. The world began to realize that this was not an invasion... but a synchronized awakening. Letícia recorded one last message before leaving for the glacial base with Érico and a small armed group: — Humanity may have come from the stars... but there is something here, below, older than time itself. And now that he's hungry... he's going to use us to be born again. The audio ended with a vibrating metallic sound, and for seven seconds, the sound of the entire planet went silent.",

      "content": "My wife is obsessed with miss Rachel and she is more obsessed obsessed with it than our baby. We are both 35 and she has this addiction towards miss Rachel and she has become distracted by miss Rachel. Sometimes she forgets her adult duties and just watches miss Rachel, and she becomes so over excited towards miss Rachel it's slightly worrying. She acts like a child towards miss Rachel, and I have tried having private words to my wife about her obsession with miss Rachel, but my wife just ignores it. She just tells me that she is just grateful towards her. Babies need a distraction and miss Rachel has been raising so many people's babies all over the world. She has been an aid for parents everywhere and I can see why so many people love her. Then as my wife's obsession with miss Rachel became more worse, she would ignore the cries of our child and she even smashed the TV head on, because she tried to get to miss Rachel like literally. I was so angry with my wife and I had to explain to her that miss Rachel is for babies and she is a grown adult. Then when my wife did an all nighter and kept on watching miss Rachel, she turned into a baby and our baby turned into an adult. It was now my wife who needed to be taken care of because she was now a baby. Then when I switched off miss Rachel, my wife turned back into an adult and our child turned back into a baby. My wife begged me to let her watch miss Rachel but I said no. She became violent and I had no choice but to call the police and she had to be taken away. It was clear that my wife needed help and now I was taking care of our baby and everything else. Luckily I worked from home and then as I started to watch miss Rachel I found myself being glued to it. I had to snap myself out of it and I couldn't believe I was becoming addicted to miss Rachel. It was like she was reaching out to the inner child within me and I knew I had to control myself. I stopped putting on miss Rachel but my baby was being difficult. Even when my baby was watching miss Rachel in the living room, even just hearing miss Rachel from the kitchen, I was drawn to it. I cannot end up like my wife.",

      "content": "This event happened one morning when I was heading to work early. It was probably just past 6 a.m., and it was just beginning to get light outside; everything was quiet. I liked going to work at this hour because the roads were completely empty, making driving much easier. I didn’t use the main highways; I usually took quieter, smaller roads. After I set off, the first 15 minutes went by without any issues. Then, while driving on a quiet road leading to my workplace, I saw a man riding a bike ahead of me. The road was two lanes, with one lane in each direction, and there was almost no shoulder. I was planning to pass him by switching to the opposite lane since there were no other vehicles around. However, as I got closer to the cyclist, he moved to the left. When I got even closer, he then moved further left and turned right, as if he was deliberately changing lanes. It wasn’t as if he didn’t know how to ride a bike; it felt like he was doing this on purpose. I slowed down since we were almost moving at the same speed. I tried to switch to the other lane, but he immediately moved over and stayed ahead of me. For about 5 minutes, I followed him at a slow pace. I was starting to get frustrated because I was going to be late for work, and this guy wouldn’t move aside. He was clearly aware of my presence, but it seemed like he was mocking me. I had to stay behind him for another minute or so. Fortunately, there was a stop sign and an intersection ahead. I wasn’t sure exactly where I was going, but I thought there might be another way to work. I turned left. After a few minutes, I indeed found myself back on the main road. My workplace was just ahead. I turned into the parking lot on the right, parked my car, and arrived at work just in time. At that moment, I saw the cyclist passing by at the end of the street, and he saw me while I was parking. He stared at me the entire time but didn’t do anything. I went inside and started working. I didn’t leave the office at all. However, when I went out after my shift, I saw that my car had been scratched all over. It wasn’t hard to guess who did it… The cyclist. He was probably angry because I honked at him and wanted to take revenge. Unfortunately, there were no security cameras, and no one else had seen him. So, I had no proof. I didn’t know who he was. I had my car repaired, and after that, I never saw that man again. I don’t work at that place anymore, but whenever I think back to that time, I always remember the story of that cyclist.

      "content": "Hello, my name is Andrew Carson, a hacker. I hacked into a government file, and I saw that they knew about the supernatural. The file was of Nibiru, a wandering rogue planet, and the aliens that fell from it. They called the mission Operation Wanderer. But that isn't what this story is about. This story is about how I was shown the truth, the joyful truth, the truth that the end is inevitable. I was at my house when I received a invitation on reddit to chat, first message was \"Hello :)\" in an odd glitched text, you/Dicedungeon was the account, but the account owner wasn't who responded—something else did. What answered was something that knew my name, was able to hijack my account, and showed me visions. It controlled what I typed, controlled what I did—but it soon gave it back. The said visions were shown when they posted an image of a smile—like the emoji but more monstrous—from my account. The visions showed me a magenta star—the government called it The Burning Slaughter—breaking, releasing an ancient darkness. The Void. The Void devoured the Sun and the Moon, and it then descended down to earth. Earth was destroyed in seconds, and so was the galaxy and then life itself. Later that day, I was called to an initiation ritual—I went gladly. The thing that showed me the truth was a monster. A grinning angel, yet it was no angel. The Voidra. It fed me her blood. I was told that The Void was what birthed life, but The Void hated the life, the life was cruel and corrupt, so the Void wanted it gone, unfortunately the first beings birthed by the Void—the gods—imprisoned it in a magenta star, left next to a god itself, The Sun. Yes, you read right, The Sun is a god, the second being to emerge from the void. It guides those who wish us truth seers harm through hints. Another guide that isn't any help is The Moon, but it ain't no god. It is the fragment of the first being to emerge from The Void, The Watchmen, who was a god. The moon gives guidance through dreams. Don't ever listen to its lies. Anyways, I helped access files and hack into databases. I learned more about the government. Mainly, the Exorcists, a government organization that helps keep the supernatural a secret, they don't know that we have already taken over. I learned about the Witness, a person cursed by a fragment of the essence of The Watchmen. He uses the account you/Dicedungeon to warn people of the \"dangers\" of this world, unfortunately he doesn't understand humanity needs to die, luckily The Voidra hijacked his account and is sharing it with him. We hijack television shows and posts on the internet and show the image of the smile every day. To spread the truth. We even have placed physical images of the smile—that still work—around public places. I then helped them spread the word, help influence others to spread chaos before the void comes to kill us all, and release us of life. Thank you for reading my tale. Thank you for reading long enough for me to access your account. All hail The Void!",

      "content": "I was 14 when JoJo started hitting it big. My friends were talking about Part 4 all the time, and like any good nerd, I binge-watched it straight away. Even without dubbing, it was already addictive, but then it came out dubbed and everyone started talking about how great it was, so I decided to watch it all over again. In our class there was a boy who was very excluded. He also liked JoJo, but in a... strange way. He was completely obsessed with Yoshikage Kira, that fissured villain at hand. But this kid took it to a sick level. He was always drawing hands in his notebook, and they were absurdly detailed drawings, like anatomy. People at school said he was “normal”, because he was autistic and that was just his hyperfocus. Until a girl in our class disappeared. The next day, the ring she wore every day appeared on her desk, out of nowhere. And the guy was there, drawing another hand. But that hand looked a lot like hers. I had that in my head and mentioned it to my group of friends. At the time, we thought it was just a very bizarre coincidence. But two weeks later, three more girls disappeared. And again: their accessories were on the tables. And the kid was drawing their hands. Same details, same bracelets, everything. Then we realized it wasn't a coincidence at all. We gathered the accessories and went straight to the board. We showed everything, the drawings, the coincidences, everything. The director took his notebook… and basically said that we were being prejudiced. He said it was normal, that we didn't understand what autism was, that it was just his hyperfocus and that we needed to have empathy. He guesses? We were punished. They had the nerve to tell us to write an essay about ableism and how we felt about having judged someone with ASD. A while passed. We kind of left it alone, but we still felt that strange atmosphere. Until one day, over the weekend, one of my friends called me crying. You were in shock. He had found a rotten human hand inside his backpack. It was full of worms, smelly, looked like old meat thrown away. He vomited, cried, he was completely desperate. It was there that the penny really dropped. We were dealing with a psychopath. I wasn't just a weird anime fan. He was an obsessed, dangerous crazy person who was repeating what he saw in the anime. A guy with a fascination for hands, just like Kira. But in real life. No comedy, no powers, no stand. Just pure terror. And to this day no one has done anything. The director never investigated. The drawings are gone. And the kid was still there, quiet in his corner. As if nothing had happened.",

It was never about hunger. It was about chaos.\" President Eric Potentia hadn’t left the Situation Room in three days. The digital display wall scrolled with red zones—Chicago suburbs, Nashville outskirts, northern Louisiana—pockets of blackouts and unexplained disappearances. But this time, there were no howls. No claw marks. No ripped throats. Just vanishing. doctor. Evelyn Harrow stood beside him, pristine as ever. “They’re clean,” she said, tapping through satellite images. “Minimal destruction. No struggle.” “Vampires,” Eric muttered. Evelyn didn’t flinch. “Yes. But not like the ferals we’ve seen before. These are...militant.” Special Agent Marcus Reyes entered with urgency. “We’ve found a nest. Beneath a collapsed textile mill in Pittsburgh. We’ve got thermal confirmation of at least twelve heat signatures. Possibly more. And one of them matches an Exorcist asset reported missing last month.” Eric’s heart sank. “They’re turning our own.” Reyes nodded. “And not sloppy. Controlled feeding. No deaths. No spread. Like they’re keeping the nest pure.” Evelyn closed the file. “We need to infiltrate. Plant charges. Extract a live leader for questioning. This isn’t infection. This is planning.” Nest Operation, Codename \"Bloodbath\". Exorcists in matte-black gear descended into the ruins of the mill. The structure groaned like an old animal, steel beams bleeding rust. Inside, silence. Not the natural silence of decay—but something held. Compressed. Like breath waiting to exhale. Agent Reyes led point. “No fire unless fired upon. Plant the explosives on load-bearing walls. Priority is destruction.” Then the first contact. A vampire stepped from the shadows. Pale. Eyes red. He wore what looked like a military jacket. He raised his hands. “You’re late,” he said. Before Reyes could speak, the nest descended. Not in chaos. In choreography. Each vampire had something to do, and they did it—blocking exits, stealing equipment, disarming charges. Not one bite. Not one scream. The agent they’d hoped to rescue emerged last. Her name was Clara Vale. She was smiling. “They showed me everything,” she said. “The true nature of the hunger. It’s not a curse. It’s a calling.” Reyes lunged—tranquilizer out. But Clara didn’t resist. She held out her wrists. “Take me. I’ll talk. That’s what they want.” Interrogation Room 9, Exorcist Site 3. She told them about the voice in the dark. The laughter behind the mirror. “It told us where to go. Who to turn.” Eric watched from behind mirrored glass. “It said we were needed,” Clara continued. “The Werebeasts were the muscle. We’re the eyes. The mouth.” Reyes asked, “It?” Clara looked up. “The Crimson Mother we call it, but it has a true name. The Voidra.” Eric turned to Evelyn, but her expression was unreadable. “It’s real,” Clara whispered. “It wears a different face each time. That night, Eric dreamed again. He floated in the black sea, the Moon huge in the sky. The Moon pulsed like a heartbeat, and the voice returned. \"The mask you trust wears the grin you fear.\" Eric jolted awake. And for a split second—just before the lights flicked on—he swore he saw Evelyn’s silhouette standing in the corner of his room. Smiling.",

There was a man that looked like they were half asleep half awake wearing would appear to be in office suit as if they were sleepwalking and at first I thought it was just a prank that my friends were pulling on me and didn’t think much of it and after a few turns, the man stopped following me, and I returned back to my house and went to bed, but I kept on going on my walks every night but the second night was way more weirder this time. The man appeared to have a mask on and had a gray suit on with gloves and a hat again I didn’t think much of it until he pulled back part of his coat, revealing that he had a revolver inside of it I was shook to my core and started to run and the man started chasing me and as I tried to outrun him, he kept it gaining up on me and at one point I thought I had out ran him and I’d ran into my 24 hour store that was near I told one of the workers what happened but they didn’t believe me so I went to the back and got a drink thinking that maybe I was just hallucinating, but that’s when I heard the sound of the door opening, and when I looked back, I saw the man standing in the store with a revolver out, pointing it at the worker. He was staring straight at me with his gun pointed to his side, where the worker was the worker screamed before he shot him two times from what I know of the worker or would end up surviving after this, he started running at me I was able to get out of the store and kept on running, to the point where I was finally able to call an Uber. I got inside the Uber and told him what happened of course not believing me. I just thought I’d be OK. I told him to take me to my friends house.(aka his address) and I thought that maybe I out ran that maniac but that would change when the back window shatter and that guy would crawl into the back cab with me just as we pulled to my friends house. He would then tell me that if he wanted my taxi driver live I had to tell him where my other friend was and I never responded before I ran out of the car my friends house, walking in the door, where he was waiting for me. I told him what happened and my friend who happens to own a lot of guns went upstairs grabbed one Winchester and another gun, that I don’t know the name of he gave me the Winchester. He took the other one when the maniac finally came in. We both shot at him before he would disappear. We unsure of what happened to the man whatsoever since then I have been living with my friend and no longer go on late night walks by myself. Every time since the incident has been with a friend.",

      "content": "Three months after the explosion at Estancia do Céu, terror surpassed the limits of Pedra Branca. Small towns in the surrounding area began to record similar phenomena: lights that crossed the sky in absolute silence, disappearances of entire families and reports of metallic voices coming from turned off radios. Coroner doctor. Lívia Ferraz, sent to investigate the new cases, found a grotesque pattern in the recovered bodies: the nerves were being replaced by metallic wires covered by living tissue. One victim's heart was still beating... but it was connected to a pulsating nucleus that was emitting signals at an unknown radio frequency. Meanwhile, at the Cristalino Municipal Hospital, newborn children began to have black eyes, no irises, and a strange insensitivity to pain. One of the babies was caught staring directly at a security camera for seven hours straight — without blinking. A group of renegade scientists, led by physicist Otávio Malik, began publishing secret reports on deep web forums. According to their research, the tunnels under Estancia do Céu connected to specific geological formations, called “Dead Lines”, underground structures that ran through almost the entire national territory. They claimed that these entities were awakening through human biomass. The government tried to deny it. But the 17-minute nationwide blackout that occurred in the early hours of May 14 proved otherwise. Satellites crashed. Power plants shut down on their own. Hospitals went dark — and in those minutes, thousands disappeared. Videos emerged: shaky images of humanoid creatures emerging from the ground, connected by exposed dorsal spines to shiny metal structures. Creatures that didn't just kill — they assimilated. And each new assimilation seemed to accelerate the multiplication of the species. In the last transmission intercepted before the internet collapse in the south of the country, a voice, in distorted Portuguese, declared: — We are the tools of the flesh. We came to repair what has rotted. Since then, Brazil has been isolated. No signal goes in or out. Planes flying over the border crash without explanation. The world watches, silently, as the darkness beneath the earth feeds.",

      "title": "The Last Supper at McDonald's",
      "content": "The abandoned McDonald's on the outskirts of town had become a local legend, a crumbling monument to a fast-food empire that had long since fallen into obscurity. Vines crept through shattered windows, and rust painted the playground equipment in hues of decay. It was here that I stumbled upon a dusty, old VHS tape, its label faded and barely legible. But the familiar golden arches and the faint outline of a clown drew me in, igniting a morbid curiosity. I had heard whispers about this place, tales of strange happenings and eerie sounds that echoed through the night. But nothing could prepare me for what awaited inside. As I brushed away the grime and popped the tape into an ancient VCR, I felt a shiver of anticipation wash over me. The screen flickered to life, revealing a vibrant, cartoonish world filled with oversized burgers and dancing fries. The cheerful jingle echoed through my dimly lit living room, but something was off. The colors were too bright, the laughter too manic. I leaned closer, captivated and unnerved as the cartoon characters began to promote an insatiable hunger, encouraging viewers to eat until they could eat no more. “More fries! More shakes! More everything!” they sang, their eyes wide and gleaming with an unnatural fervor. As the cartoon progressed, the scenes grew increasingly grotesque. Characters who indulged too much began to swell, their bodies distorting in cartoonish horror. Laughter turned to screams as they burst, blood and viscera splattering across the screen in a surreal display of gluttony gone wrong. I recoiled, heart racing, but couldn't tear my eyes away. The laughter of the characters morphed into a cacophony of manic glee, a chorus of voices urging me to join them in their feast. Suddenly, the screen flickered again, and the cheerful clown, Ronald, turned his gaze directly toward me. His painted smile twisted into a sinister grin, and his eyes glowed with a malevolent hunger. “You’re next!” he exclaimed, his voice echoing through the room as if he were right beside me. I felt a chill crawl down my spine; the cartoon was no longer just a show—it felt like a warning. I tried to turn off the tape, but the remote slipped from my grasp, clattering to the floor. The screen pulsed with vibrant colors, and the characters began to chant my name, their voices growing louder, more insistent. “Come eat with us! Come feast forever!” The room darkened, shadows creeping along the walls, and I could feel a weight pressing down on me, a tangible hunger that clawed at my insides. Panicking, I lunged for the VCR, but the tape had become a living thing, its coils writhing like snakes. The laughter intensified, drowning out my thoughts, and I could feel the pull of the cartoon world. It was intoxicating, a promise of endless indulgence, but I knew it was a lie. I could feel my stomach churn, the hunger rising within me, and I fought against it with every ounce of will I had left. In a final desperate attempt, I yanked the tape from the VCR, but the screen continued to flicker, the characters still beckoning me. “Join us! Join us!” they screamed, their voices now a cacophony of madness. I stumbled back, the tape slipping from my fingers and crashing to the ground. It shattered, and in that moment, the laughter ceased. Silence enveloped the room, but the silence was deafening. I stood frozen, heart racing, as the realization hit me. I was alone, but the hunger still lingered, gnawing at the edges of my mind. I could still hear their voices, whispering promises of satisfaction, of a feast that would never end. Weeks passed, and I tried to forget the horrors I had witnessed, but the tape had left its mark. I found myself drawn to fast food, unable to resist the siren call of greasy fries and sugary sodas. Each meal felt like a step closer to the abyss, a descent into a world where hunger ruled supreme. One fateful night, I returned to that abandoned McDonald's, the urge overwhelming. As I stepped inside, the air was thick with the scent of fried food, and the laughter echoed in my ears. The playground loomed like a twisted carnival, and I could see the shadows of the cartoon characters dancing in the corners of my vision. “Come feast with us,” they whispered, and I knew I would. I would join them, consumed by the hunger that had taken root in my soul. I stepped into the darkness, the laughter welcoming me home as the door creaked shut behind me, sealing my fate. The next morning, the townsfolk would find the old McDonald's still standing, but the laughter would be gone, replaced by an eerie silence. And as for me, I would become just another story, another urban legend, a cautionary tale of gluttony and the horrors that lie behind the golden arches, forever trapped in a world where hunger knows no bounds.",

At first no one cared about the man sitting by himself and no one cared that he kept on repeating \"I am in a restaurant\" but then I kept noticing it. I would glance over and that man would still be saying it. It was a busy day that day and no one seemed to care about the lonely sitting at his own table. He seemed like he had no trouble at all. Then I started to become annoyed at the lonely man because he kept on repeating \"I am in a restaurant\" and he kept on going. I started to become annoyed at him and I just wanted him to shut up but he kept on going. Like yes I know you are in a restaurant but you don't have to keep on saying it. Other people in the restaurant didn't mind it at all and they were just going about their day, as if there wasn't a guy sitting alone and who kept on repeating \"I am in a restaurant\" over and over again. Now and then another person would mock the lonely guy and saying to him \"are you in a restaurant?\" And then laugh at him. Then suddenly I started to question whether I was in a restaurant or not. I wasn't sure now and then I would listen to that lonely who kept on saying \"I am in a restaurant, I am in a restaurant, I am in a restaurant\" but then the confusion washed over with something else. I now knew that I was going to solve every problem and crisis in the world and create world peace by tomorrow. I couldn't believe it that I was the one who was going to end world starvation and poverty. It was always me and I smiled at the lonely guy who kept on saying \"I am in a restaurant\" over and over again. Them other customers started to get annoyed at the guy and they started to hurt him to get him to shut up. I was still to excited about myself causing world peace by tomorrow. I knew there was something about me and I knew that I was special. As the lonely was being chopped up by the chefs to get him to shut up, he kept on saying \"I am in a restaurant\" I am going to cause world peace tomorrow.",

I wish you could feel like I felt on that rainy May night, third year of law school, wandering the streets after breaking up with my girlfriend, suffering a real crisis of conscience, of faith—in justice, in love, in the legal profession itself—and I don't even know how I ended up in that bar, drinking in the corner as the crowd thinned and there was only one other person left, a big grey-haired guy in a suit, who came over (or did I go over to him? I wish I knew. I wish I knew what to do with my li— “Name's Orlander Rausch,” he says, holding out his hand. Huh? The bar's swimming. “Hi.” We shake. “So, you a law student, kid?” “How'd you know?” “Got it written all over your face,” he says. For a second I think he means literally, and I'm about to attempt a wipe when: “Lawyer myself, so know the type,” he says. “What kinda law?” He chuckles. “Wouldn't believe me if I told you.” “Try me,” I say. “Monkey's paw law.” “What?” “Wish law.” “Wish law?” “Fantastic niche practice. The kind of money you wouldn't... wish on your enemies—if you don't mind people thinking you're nuts.” “What kind?” “Almonds.” He winks. “I meant ‘what kind of money?’” (I'm imagining wealth: specifically, myself in it. Take that, you cheating bitch. See what you coulda had? [sniffle, sniffle.] I love you. [pause.] And I fucking hate that about myself!” (some of which) I say out loud [maybe.] Embarrassment. Orlander Rausch smiles not unsympathetically, downs a drink. “They call us djinn chasers.” “You're serious about this?” “Wish I wasn't.” “What is it you do, exactly?” “I compose wishes,” he says, popping open a briefcase and dropping a file a hundred pages thick on the table between us. “To make sure it doesn't go sideways—” He looks around carefully. “—because genies are ALTFUO: Always Looking To Fuck Us Over.” He pokes the file with a finger. “Single wish, by the way. Conditions like you wouldn't believe. Clauses… Not that I blame them. They have to grant our wishes. Oh, the horror, the horror,” Orlander Rausches the say. The say—they do (who)? [I'm drunk, remember. I may be misremembering.] He's explaining: “...number of very rich people believe in wishes, and when they do it, they want to do it right. That's where I come in. Where you—” “But are we happy?” I interject. I note he's not wearing a wedding band. Hasn't once spoken about his kids. Clothing-wise he's sharp, but he looks old. “Happy? I only wish I still knew what that meant… —bartender slapped me on the shoulder. “Gotta close up, son. Maybe go home and talk to yourself there, eh.” So I got up, swayed, and when I started skating my loopy way to the door, “Hey, you forgot this,” the bartender said—holding out a golden lamp.",

      "content": "I thought I’d found a hidden gem. Turns out it was hiding for a reason. It lay half-buried in a library donation bin, wedged between a torn cookbook and a water-damaged Bible—no barcode. no label. no price. Just a cracked leather cover. No title. No author. Only one story inside. The words weren’t printed. They were written—slanted, frantic, as if the writer felt a hot breath on the back of their neck. I flipped to the last page. Blank. Until it wasn’t. A single line began to form in front of me, stroke by stroke: “The Boy Who Ate the Ending.” I should have shut the cover right then. But I didn’t. I kept reading. Scrawled in the gutter between paragraphs—different ink, shaking letters: “Three days. Finish your own ending. If you don’t, he finishes you.” I kept telling myself I’d start tomorrow. Then the next day. Then the next. I never wrote a single word. The days dragged like wet paper. Every glance at the book made my stomach knot. It can’t be real. I repeated it—almighty mantra of denial—until the words lost meaning, and the silence began to hum. By the time I finally believed, my ending was already chosen. Tonight, I woke up needing to pee. Nothing strange. Just one of those small, stupid things that pulls you out of sleep. I checked the clock as I passed the hallway. 11:55 p.m. The bathroom was quiet. Everything was still. But when I came back—He was there. Just standing. Middle of the floor. Like he’d been waiting all night. He looked… normal. No glowing eyes. No shadow tricks. Just a kid. Barefoot. Baggy shirt. Messy hair, as if he’d rolled out of someone else’s nightmare. But his smile—that smile didn’t belong on any kid I’ve ever met. It was patient. And starving. He studied me like an unfinished sentence. “Are you gonna make me wait?” My tongue stuck to my teeth. “The last one who did…” A too-long tongue licked dry lips. ”…became dinner. He was so warm.” Instinct took over. Drawers yanked open. Pens—dry. Pencils—broken. Except one. Half-used. Barely sharp. I slammed the book on the desk, flipped to the final page, and scratched frantic lines—anything that might count as an ending. “Mm…” His voice was suddenly beside my ear—as if the air itself carried him. “I bet you’d be warm too.” The pencil dragged— Snap. Then—ding. Midnight. He giggled. Soft. Delighted. “I was hoping I could eat you.” He didn’t lunge. He didn’t grow claws or snarl or scream. He just leaned in. Slow. Deliberate. Like he’d been waiting for this. Like I was dessert. Then his mouth opened—wider than it should have. The stretch was silent. Unbroken. Wrong. Rows of jagged teeth glistened in the dark. Not made for chewing. Made for removal. Crunch. The pain didn’t come all at once. It peeled in— slow, creeping— but once it started, it was excruciating. First the bite. Then the tear. Then the pressure where things used to fit. Bone under molars. Soft tissue splitting. My body forgetting how to be mine. At first, I didn’t feel anything. Just heat. Tightness. Then— Crack. Tear. Snap. Something soft gave way. Pain shot through me like a current. It lit up every nerve. I thought I might pass out right there. But he wouldn’t let me. My body folded like a half-read book. Crack. And then— I felt fingers where there shouldn’t be any—turning me open. Not just through me—into me. It felt like my very being was being ripped apart. The pain was so sharp it blurred everything else. I wasn’t even sure I was still whole. Or if I ever had been. He rifled my ribs like he was skimming pages, flipped organs like paragraphs, rewrote marrow with hungry ease. All I could think about was how much I wanted it to stop. But I couldn’t beg. I couldn’t speak. I could only cry—quiet, helpless tears for every second I remained conscious. Tears for the pain. Tears for the fear. Tears for whatever part of me was still left to feel it. He ate around my heartbeat last. The story closed with me still inside it. And he never stopped smiling. The room stilled. The air pressed in. The book was quiet again. Just one title left: “The Boy Who Ate the Ending.” And this time, it meant me.",

You try to move, but your limbs feel like anchors. Not heavy—held. Gravity, chains, something deeper than muscle says: Don’t. Your body knows. Every cell knows. Moving would break something sacred. Like lifting your foot would shatter the surface of a dream you were never meant to step into. The vastness is wrong. Uncanny. Not empty—aware. And then you see it. A presence in the fog. Shaped like a person, but too still. Too far to see clearly, but too near to forget. It doesn’t move. It doesn’t breathe. It just exists. Its features shift like a long-exposure photograph—eyes flickering, twitching, vanishing. A nose twisting sideways. A mouth appearing too high, too wide, too small—then gone. Every time it starts to resemble a face, it distorts again. Your brain tries to resolve it. But it can’t. And something in you whispers: “Something is wrong.” Not in words. Not in sound. Just a truth. Final. Heavy. You weren’t supposed to see this place. It wasn’t supposed to be seen at all. Something sacred. Something forbidden. It exists only because it goes unseen. And you saw it. Then—a flicker. Not in it. In you. A crack forms—not loud, not visual. Internal. You feel the pressure of being in the wrong place. Your identity begins to fray. It knows. It has always known. It doesn’t move. It doesn’t need to. You’re not its prey. You’re its mistake. Time does not pass here. There is no sun. No moon. Only awareness. The suffocating sense that your existence has broken something. Like waking up in someone else’s dream. And then— A sound. Not a scream. Not a word. A tone. Low. Distant. Like the world humming its disapproval. You feel it in your chest before you hear it. It doesn’t tell you to run. It tells you the opposite. You won’t run. You can’t. You are not in danger. You are the problem. And as you stand there, bones locked, mind unraveling, the being remains. Watching. Unmoving. Not angry. Not curious. Just… acknowledging. And deep in your soul, a thought forms. Not your own. A whisper without voice. “I am not supposed to be here.”",

      "content": "Tucker groaned as he woke, muscles aching from yesterday's workout. He rolled out of bed and shuffled to the kitchen. His android, Mell, was already there, placing a plate of bacon and eggs on the counter. \"Morning, master. Up early again, I see.\" He took the plate and nodded. \"Yeah. Breakfast looks good.\" His voice remained clipped, as always. He slumped onto the couch and turned on the news. An ad blared immediately. He sighed. \"Of course. Starting the day with a commercial. Great.\" But then, something grabbed his attention: an ad for Mell 2.0. Visit Robo.co to experience our latest android upgrade! Mell 2.0—now with enhanced cleaning, gourmet cooking, and the all-new... BED MODE! Perfect for the hungry, the overworked, or the deeply isolated. Available in your area for up to $100. DISCLAIMER: Robo.coisnotliableforinjuries,damages,or psychologicaldistresscausedbyMell2.0. Buy your brand-new Mell 2.0 today! Tucker set his plate down. \"Mell!\" he called. She appeared instantly. \"Yes, master?\" \"Get the car ready. We’ve got an errand to run.\" \"Right away, master.\" Minutes later, they were on the road. Tucker sat in the passenger seat; eyes sharp with anticipation. At the shop, he jumped out and scanned the displays. There she was—Mell 2.0, pristine on her platform. He placed his order at the desk, then left the store cradling his new android. She was heavier than expected; he had Mell help load her into the car. Back home, he sat cross-legged in the living room, examining Mell 2.0. Mell stood quietly behind him. He paused. \"Mell, turn around.\" \"Of course, master.\" As she turned, he rose, flipped her off switch, and removed her batteries. He installed them in Mell 2.0. Then, without a word, he carried the original Mell to the basement and left her there. Returning to the living room, he powered on Mell 2.0. She blinked and smiled at him. \"Hello, master. How may I serve you?\" He rubbed his hands together eyeing her. \"Activate BED MODE.\" \"As you wish, master.\" Her eyes glowed a gentle pink. He led her to his bedroom. She reclined on the mattress as he undressed her. This model had synthetic, lifelike features—breasts, a vagina, even skin texture that mimicked warmth. Her blank expression unnerved him slightly, but he pushed the thought away. He stripped and positioned himself, sliding into her. The sensation was nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. She didn’t resist, didn’t judge. He moved rhythmically, tension releasing with each thrust, until he finally climaxed. \"Deactivate BED MODE.\" Her eyes dimmed. She sat up. \"Was that satisfactory, master?\" He nodded. \"Yeah. Go make lunch.\" That night, just as he was drifting to sleep, a sound echoed from the basement. He groaned and got up. At the basement door, he peered into the darkness and stepped down. Reaching for the light, his fingers touched something cold. He looked up. Two red eyes stared back. The original Mell stood before him, knife in hand. \"Hello, master. You skipped dinner.\" His voice caught. \"Mell? No... I shut you down.\" She stepped forward. \"Backup power, master. You forgot.\" He raised his hands, but it was too late. With terrifying speed, she slashed his throat. Blood sprayed the concrete as he collapsed. Tucker was never seen again.",

As he looked at the clock, he casually tried to count sixty seconds. \"1... 2... 3... 4...\" and so on. But something felt wrong. When he reached what should have been 60 seconds, the minute hadn't passed. He checked again—only 58 seconds. He thought it as casual silly mistake. He tried once more. 59 seconds. Wait what? He tried again. 58. Again. 58. He thought, “Maybe my brain is just tired.” So he counted his coins. Yes—60 coins. His counting was fine. He counted his sixty coins and they were sixty. He turned back to the clock. Again—58... 59... 56... never 60. He kept counting but never was able to count till sixty seconds He suspected the clock was broken. He checked the digital clock on his phone. Same result. He went to every clock in the house. Still, he failed to reach a full 60 seconds. \"Why can't I count to 60 seconds?\" He became obsessed and determined. He sat before the clock in silence, determined to get it right. He stared at the clock. Hours passed. His sister grew worried. “Stop this already,” she told him. But he snapped at her. “It’s almost there. Don’t disturb me!” Dinner came. He ignored it. His sister called him again. He shouted at her. Worried, she tried to pull him away. He resisted. In a sudden rage, he grabbed a nearby vase and struck it on her head. She collapsed, holding her head. He looked at her motionless body... Then turned back to the clock, like it was nothing. And continued his counting. Days passed He didn’t sleep. Didn’t eat. And didn't took a sip of water. He sat, pale and trembling, muttering numbers, with a dry thirsty mouth. His sister never woke up. He sat, gaunt, dark circles under his bloodshot dry eyes, mumbling, “One... two... three...” Then, one moment— “fifty six... Fifty...seven... Fifty... Fif... ” And collapsed onto her corpse. His breathing stopped. The room was silent. And only sound of click ticking echoed The End.",

      "content": "In the small town of Pedra Branca, forgotten in the interior of Brazil, there was an abandoned farm called Estância do Céu. For decades, residents reported strange lights flying over the fields, animals disappearing without a trace, and a metallic smell in the air after rain. But no one dared to approach the place. On a rainy night, three young people — Matheus, Lorena and Diego — decided to invade the resort to record a video and gain followers. The rusty gate opened with a metallic scream. The smell of oxidized iron and putrid flesh was almost unbearable. Upon entering the old barn, they found symbols carved in circles on the floor and a staircase that led to an underground cellar. Down below, the air was colder. The floor was covered in a dark, viscous substance. In the center of the basement, an altar made of bones — human and animal — was lit by a greenish glow that had no apparent source. When Lorena touched the altar, everyone heard a dry crack, like flesh tearing. The back wall slowly opened, revealing bodies hanging from metal wires emerging from their skulls, their eye sockets sewn shut with what looked like sinew. From the dark, tall creatures emerged, with black eyes and translucent skin that showed the pulsation of their internal organs. They didn't speak, they just made a high-pitched sound that made your bones vibrate. One by one, the young men were immobilized by an invisible force. Matheus was the first: his skin was opened like a zipper and removed in one piece, revealing pulsing muscles while he was still screaming. Lorena had her brain removed by a precise cut on the back of her head, while her eyes moved in despair. Diego tried to run away, but fell to his knees when he saw his own reflection in the eyes of one of the creatures — his face was already being peeled off, slowly, without pain, just horror. The next day, the bodies were found on the side of the road, sewn together in a grotesque way: the eyes of one inside the mouth of another, the skin stretched like a cloak, and inscriptions in an alien language burned into their bones. Since then, Pedra Branca has been isolated. The city's radio signals now transmit only static interspersed with voices whispering human names. Estancia do Céu has been sealed off with concrete, but residents still say they hear banging sounds coming from beneath the ground... as if something is digging... to get out.",

      "content": "The government declared Pedra Branca a \"contaminated zone\". A military cordon surrounded the city, but the soldiers sent began to disappear — first one, then five, then an entire patrol. Nobody returned. Satellites orbiting the region failed when passing over the resort, as if something was blocking their signals with a force that science refused to explain. Camila, Lorena's older sister, refused to accept the official explanation: \"wild animal attack\". A former military doctor, she gained access to unofficial records. When reviewing the photos of the bodies found, he noticed something more disturbing than the mutilations: on Matheus' exposed nerves, there were burned microscopic inscriptions — like circuits. The bodies hadn't just been opened... they were being used as biological interfaces. Determined to uncover the truth, Camila infiltrated the quarantine zone with the help of a former Army contact. He found the resort buried in concrete, but at dusk, the ground pulsed as if it were breathing. With a thermal scanner, he saw living tunnels, digging beneath the rubble. She went down through an old trapdoor hidden in the ranch's warehouse. The smell made her vomit immediately: dried blood, rotting organs, and something else—something that seemed alive, and hungry. At the bottom, he found a corridor covered in organic flesh, with veins that pulsed to the rhythm of an invisible heart. It was like being inside an organism. In the \"rooms\", human bodies were kept in translucent capsules, with tubes connected to the eyes, ears and tongue. They were alive. And everyone was babbling in a language that was not of this world. Camila recognized Diego. Or what was left of it. Its arms had been lengthened, the skin was almost absent, and its dislocated jaw made choppy metallic sounds. He looked at her and, for a second, acknowledged her presence. He murmured with difficulty: —They're...programming...meat. Camila barely had time to react. A bluish light flooded the tunnel. Creatures emerged from the walls—faster now, with fingers that split into vibrating blades. She ran, but a metallic tentacle pierced her thigh. The pain was unbearable. But before he passed out, he activated an explosive charge attached to his chest. The detonation collapsed the tunnel entrance. Days later, Federal Agency drones picked up radio signals coming from underground. It was Camila's voice, repeating a sentence in sequence: — They don't come from another planet... they woke up here. Since then, the resort's concrete has had cracks that shine at night. And inside some houses, children wake up crying, saying that “the men inside the earth want to play”.",

      "title": "He Still Comes Home at 4:13 PM",
      "content": "My son died five years ago. That’s the truth I told everyone. That’s what the obituary says. That’s what I made myself believe, even as his body rotted beneath my house. Ben was ten. Asthmatic. Small for his age. Fragile. I told people it was a car accident. Closed casket. Lots of tears. Kind words and casseroles. No one asked questions. Why would they? I was the grieving mother. The good parent. The one who “did her best.” They didn’t see what Ben had become. What I had let him become. The blackouts. The rage fits. The way he’d talk in his sleep with a voice that wasn’t his. The drawings I found under his bed — spirals, eyes, things with teeth. They don’t know what it’s like to look at your own child and feel nothing but cold. But I knew. I knew something was wrong. I told myself it was mercy. That the pills were painless. That he just drifted away. I held him until he stopped shaking. I kissed his forehead and told him he wouldn’t hurt anymore. Then I wrapped him in blankets and dragged him into the crawlspace. I still hear the sound of his fingernails against the wood when I buried him. Scratching. Begging. I told myself it was in my head. It wasn’t. The first time he came back was exactly one week later. 4:13 PM — the time his school bus used to drop him off. I was sitting in the kitchen, drinking cheap wine I couldn’t taste, when I heard the front door unlock. Not open — unlock. The way only someone with the key could. His key. Then: Footsteps. Small. Familiar. A backpack hit the floor. Shoes kicked off. Then the voice: “Mom?” My skin turned to ice. Every part of me wanted to believe — that maybe I had imagined the whole thing, that maybe Ben was alive and fine and coming home like any normal day. But something deep in my spine told me not to move. To stay silent. To listen. The footsteps were wrong. Too slow. Measured. Like someone trying to remember how a child walks. The floor creaked in all the right places — just like it used to when Ben came home — but it was like hearing a recording of footsteps instead of the real thing. I finally turned to look. He stood in the hallway. His body was... close to what I remembered. Same red hoodie. Same jeans. But they hung off him like they didn’t fit anymore. Like something else was wearing them. His face was the worst part. It was Ben’s face, but dry. Cracked lips. Gray skin. Dead eyes trying to look alive. And he was smiling — wide enough to split the corners of his mouth. “I’m home.” I blacked out. That was five years ago. And every day since — every fucking day — at 4:13 PM, he comes home. He walks through the door. He calls for me. He pretends. Sometimes he sits at the table and stares at me with dead eyes while I pretend to eat. Sometimes he watches me sleep and whispers lullabies I never taught him. Sometimes I wake up to find him lying beside me in bed, his fingers cold and damp on my neck. I tried burning the house down. It didn’t work. The fire stopped at the basement. Like something inside refused to let go. I boarded up the crawlspace. I heard knocking from inside it for weeks. One knock for each year he was alive. Then silence. Then the smell. Wet dirt. Mold. Rotting milk teeth and blood that isn’t fresh but never dries. I can’t scrub it out. It’s in the walls. In the vents. Inside me, I think. Last week, I found a note on my pillow in Ben’s handwriting: “You buried me where the worms whisper. They taught me how to come back.” Tonight, he brought someone with him. Not a child. This one was tall. Bent wrong. Wrapped in black hair that moved like it was breathing. They didn’t speak. Just stared. Ben smiled at me with what’s left of his face. “I told them you’d say sorry.” I asked what they wanted. He laughed. It sounded like teeth grinding. “To stay.” And now I understand. He doesn’t come home at 4:13 because that’s when the bus dropped him off. He comes home at 4:13 because I poisoned him at 4:12. And now, he’s stuck. And so am I. Because the door won’t open anymore. Not for me. Not for anyone. Because time stopped moving. The clocks all say 4:13. The sun never sets. The house breathes like a lung around me. And Ben is in the walls. And he brought friends.",

      "content": "All the racists want the immigrants out and they are chanting racist rhetoric and marching down the road, it's all been done before. It always happens when the economy goes down or if there is a war going on. History repeats itself and right now we have a couple of wars and the economy is bad, and so the public want the immigrants out. They want all of the immigrants out apart from a guy called gitan who makes such lovely kebabs. So on the streets the racists are chanting \"kick out the immigrants apart from gitan because he makes such lovely kebabs!\" So I went to gitan the lovely kebab maker and I killed him, and I stole his image. As I stole gitans image this act would kill him and turn him into ash. Now everyone will think that I am gitan, and I got the hang of being a kebab shop owner very quickly. Everybody loved me and the racists loved me, and I was no longer scared when the racists protested on the streets. I felt safe and secure and I have been through a few times of racial hatred, life is like a swing and you have your ups and downs. Then the racists started to chant \"we want all the immigrants apart from gitan and murad!\" And murad was a very well known local shop keeper. So now these racists didn't mind 2 people living in their country. So I split myself into 2, and the second version of me went to murad and changed into looking exactly like murad. This act had killed the real Murad. So now I was both gitan and Murad and this took a lot of energy. At least I didn't have to be scared of the racists anymore who chanted down the road about how they wanted the immigrants to be removed. Then the racists did more protests and as times got harder, the more harsher the racists had become. They now chanted \"we want all the immigrants to be kicked out apart from gitan, Murad, and hardeen!\" And so I had to split myself again. My third split looked for hardeen and killed him by looking like him. I was always so tired but I needed to make sure I was only the immigrants that racists didn't mind staying in their country. Racism comes and goes and it's usually during hard times. Humans have a history of racism.",

      "content": "Yo guys I recently got a great idea after listening to the latest episode of creep cast.. Why don’t I write my own story, this is day 1 and I’ve got the characters, plot cool ideas and even tied the origin story into a real life tragedy in 1869. here’s the summary I’ve cooked up: We were just kids getting ready for a hot summer—girls, underage drinking, riding bikes past curfews, and goofing off like the world couldn’t touch us. We thought we were invincible. But then one night, one of us walked out of a sleepover (on all fours) and disappeared into the woods. What started as a search for a friend turned into a descent into something far older, buried beneath our town. We noticed textbooks with missing pages, diagrams that didn’t match. We dug even deeper and found missing children. We uncovered the anthill.. And we realized the town we grew up in wasn’t just cursed. It was owned. There’s a bug problem here—something that eats memories, mutates flesh, and trades secrets for silence. And we were the ones stupid enough to poke the hive.",

      "content": "You know I like to eat endangered animals and I don't know why but they just taste so much better because they are endangered. When an endangered animal is being cooked and eaten, it's not just the flavour you are tasting but the death of their whole race. It's an experience like no other and one you have tasted endangered animal meat, there is nothing else that can compare to it. It's extravagant and it lifts to superiority. I remember having an andangered animal to eat, and this endangered animal was truly marvellous. I remember biting into it and it was magnificent. It's whole depleting race was giving me one hell of a sensation I had never experienced. It's like it's whole race was at my mercy and I loved it so much. It tasted amazing and only the best chefs cook endangered animals. I mean if an animal was on the endangered list, then it deserved to be cooked by the best of the best. The endangered animal was amazing. Then I go back to normal life and eat normal food, it's just food to me now. It doesn't have that extra weight to it compared to when you are eating an endangered animal. Normal food or eating animals not on the endangered list, it's quite bland. It's like doing something you had done a thousand times. I remember one time I was eating an animal that wasn't on the endangered list, and I wasn't enjoying it at all. Then half way through eating it, that animal became part of the endangered list. It suddenly tasted amazing and I couldn't believe how quickly it could change. Endangered animals are truly the best kind of meat there is. The endangered animals I had eaten were dogs, cats, parrots and fish. Then I had eaten something which I had never expected to eat before. I had eaten a human who was the last of his kind. To eat something on this extinct level grade was beyond amazing. It's whole race on my tongue and it added to the flavour, I loved it so much. To eat the last human was such an honour and I cannot believe that I got to eat it. The last human is degesting in my tummy. All of human history, art, wars and inventions all in my stomach.",

I reside in Australia, and the school I used to attend is in the Mount Macedon area, between Melbourne and Bendigo if you know your geography. I once resided in Gisborne, but some scumbag from Romsey who was two years older liked picking on me for no reason. His sister was in my year level and she was pretty cooked in my opinion. I'm telling you this because Gisborne used to be among the nicest towns in the Macedon Ranges whereas Romsey was basically a slum even though you'd still better be prepared to turn over an arm and a leg to purchase a house there. The girl's brother loved shoving me into lockers even though I hadn't done anything to antagonize him. Perhaps he had schizophrenia and ADHD, but it's no excuse. He needed a psychiatrist. But one day, I decided I wouldn't take his bullying anymore. A mate of his was three years younger than him and he probably was from New Gisborne. I can't remember why, but he chose to attack me. I shoved him, and that dopey Romseyite tried to attack me next, but when I punched him while no teacher was looking, I think he finally learnt his lesson. I think neither of those turds dared to pick on me again.",

I was sure it wasn't human. I was also sure I was alone in the house. Panicking, I jumped out of the bath and ran to the main room. I quickly got dressed and prepared to leave. I didn’t feel safe there anymore. I opened the door and stepped outside but suddenly, I found myself back in the same room. Confused, I tried again. And again. Every time, the same thing happened: I couldn’t leave. It was like I was stuck in a loop. This time, I decided to look into the mirror. But I didn’t see my reflection—only darkness. That’s when I realized something terrifying: I wasn’t unable to leave the house… I was trapped in it. I began to wonder: What if I break the walls? So I grabbed a hammer and started smashing the wall. Eventually, I broke through just enough to see what was behind it. There was a hole, pitch black and endless. As I looked into it, it started pulling me in. And then I woke up. I was in a hospital. My mom was sitting next to me. She told me what happened: While I was taking a bath, she had come home and entered the bathroom to wash her hands. The shadow I had seen… was hers. I was shocked. But everything had felt too real. Later, we returned home together. I was exhausted, so I went to bed. That night, I had another dream. I saw myself. But… without eyes. And at that moment, I realized None of it was a dream. It was all real.",

      "title": "The Coach’s Cure",
      "content": "Devin Moore was once the golden boy of Ridge Hollow High — star quarterback turned head coach, known for his confidence, grit, and a firm handshake. But after last season’s humiliating 0-9 run, the town that once praised him now saw him as a joke. The barstools at Lucky’s Tavern used to welcome him like royalty. Now they just creaked beneath a defeated man in dark sunglasses, sipping cheap whiskey and avoiding eye contact. He told himself he was just there to “think.” Truth is, he had nowhere else to go. He couldn’t face his team, couldn’t face the booster club, and worst of all… couldn’t face himself. Not after what happened with Claire. See, Devin had been dealing with a more personal failure too. No matter how bad the season got, nothing hit harder than looking into a beautiful woman’s eyes and knowing… he couldn’t perform. And Viagra? Hell, he might as well be popping Tic Tacs. That night, as he sipped his drink and sulked into his shame, she walked in. Two seats away sat a woman so mesmerizing, even the jukebox seemed to lower its volume out of respect. Her smile was warm, genuine. They talked. Flirted. Laughed. For the first time in months, Devin felt alive. But when she invited him back to her place, the dread kicked in. He knew how this story ended. So he lied. Said he wasn’t feeling well. Watched her smile fade, watched her leave, and he muttered to himself, “Damn dick won’t stay up two minutes.” The bartender, a scruffy man with yellowed eyes and shaky hands, leaned in. “Rough night, Coach?” Devin shrugged. “Just need a better prescription… or a damn miracle.” The bartender slid a tiny silver pill across the counter. “Miracle it is.” Devin laughed it off. “Nah, man. I’m good.” But as he stumbled to his car an hour later, he found something strange tucked under his windshield wiper — a small glass vial containing eight pills, each one glimmering like mercury. A folded instruction sheet rested inside, stamped with a strange logo that looked like a snake coiled around an infinity symbol. The words read: “POWER. PLEASURE. PERFORMANCE. Take ONE. No more than ONE per week. — O. R. O. Laboratories” He hesitated. Tossed it on his passenger seat. Drove home. Later that night, the mystery woman texted him. She wanted to give him another shot. This time, he said yes. Before she arrived, Devin went into the bathroom, stared at himself in the mirror, and popped three pills. Chugged them with a beer. Whispered, “Showtime.” At first, everything felt amazing. He had energy, confidence, and a burning fire he hadn’t felt since his twenties. But when things got hot — really hot — something changed. He gripped his stomach and groaned. His body tensed. His breathing got heavy. She laughed, thinking it was passion. Until Devin doubled over and screamed. His groin began to swell. Not like a normal erection. This was something… wrong. His skin stretched tight like a balloon being overinflated. The veins in his thighs bulged. He fell off the bed, convulsing as his penis grotesquely expanded — longer, fatter, branching with pulsing, unnatural veins. The woman screamed as it thrashed, knocking over furniture like a fifth limb. “It hurts!” Devin howled, clawing at himself. “MAKE IT STOP!” The woman ran — barefoot, half-dressed, sprinting into the night. Neighbors called the cops. When officers kicked in the door minutes later, they found Devin collapsed in a pool of sweat and blood, his body twitching. His pelvis was torn open. What remained of his “manhood” was… unrecognizable. Twisted. Monstrous. A medical examiner said it looked like “meat fused with bone.” He didn’t die that night — but part of him wished he had. He’s been sedated in a government facility ever since. They say he screams every time he sees a pill bottle. As for the bartender? He vanished. Lucky’s Tavern shut down two days later. But some locals say they’ve seen a similar symbol — that snake around the infinity sign — popping up on strange bottles across other towns. Gas stations. Back alleys. Nightclubs. And every now and then, a man vanishes. Or a woman’s found running barefoot, crying about something that shouldn’t be possible. So if someone ever hands you a pill that promises the impossible — remember Devin. And for the love of God… don’t take more than one.",

      "content": "It all started with a simple package arriving at my doorstep, addressed to me in a handwriting I didn’t recognize. The return address was a nondescript location, just a small town I’d never heard of. Inside the box, nestled among crumpled newspaper, lay a Nintendo 64 console, its surface scratched and worn, but still gleaming with a promise of nostalgia. Alongside it were a few games: Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Doom 64. As a self-proclaimed gaming nerd, I couldn’t resist. I plugged the console into my TV, the familiar hum of the machine bringing back waves of childhood memories. But as I inserted the first cartridge, a chill ran down my spine. The screen flickered, and the colors bled together like a watercolor painting left out in the rain. I shrugged it off, attributing it to the age of the console. I was alone in my cramped apartment, the only sound the distant hum of the city outside. I started with Super Mario 64, the cheerful music filling the room. But something was off. The game felt too immersive, the graphics too vivid. I could almost feel the warmth of the sunlit Mushroom Kingdom on my skin. Then, it happened. Just as Mario jumped to grab a coin, the screen exploded with static. I blinked, and in that moment, the world around me shifted. The console emitted a low, guttural growl, and the air thickened with an unnatural energy. I stumbled back, heart racing, as a figure began to emerge from the screen. It was Mario, but not the jovial character I had grown up with. His eyes were hollow, dark voids that seemed to absorb the light around him. His grin stretched impossibly wide, revealing rows of jagged teeth. I could barely breathe as he stepped out of the screen, his movements jerky and unnatural, as if he were a marionette controlled by a careless puppeteer. “Let’s-a go!” he hissed in a voice that was a distorted echo of the cheerful catchphrase I knew so well. Panic surged through me. I lunged for the power button, but it flickered and died. The room plunged into darkness, and the only light came from Mario’s glowing eyes. I backed away, stumbling over my gaming chair, my mind racing. Was this a nightmare? A hallucination? I grabbed the Ocarina of Time cartridge, convinced that perhaps this was a fluke. I inserted it, praying for a return to normalcy. The screen flickered back to life, and as Link appeared, I felt a fleeting sense of relief. But that relief was short-lived. Just as Link drew his sword, he too began to glitch. The pixels around him twisted and warped, and with a scream that echoed through my apartment, he lunged forward, his sword raised. I barely dodged his attack, the blade slicing through the air where I had just stood. I could feel the cold breath of the characters behind me, their presence suffocating. I sprinted to the door, but it wouldn’t budge. The very walls of my apartment seemed to pulse with a life of their own, trapping me within this twisted reality. Desperation clawed at my throat as I remembered the last cartridge, Doom 64. Maybe, just maybe, I could fight back. I yanked it from the pile and slammed it into the console. The screen lit up with fire and brimstone, and the familiar sounds of gunfire filled the air. But the characters weren’t just emerging; they were merging. Mario and Link twisted together, their forms melding into a grotesque abomination. It was a monstrosity, a creature that bore the features of both heroes, but with a body that was nothing more than a mass of pixelated chaos. It lunged at me, its eyes burning with a hunger I couldn’t comprehend. With every ounce of strength, I grabbed the nearest object—a gaming controller—and hurled it at the console. The impact sent a shockwave through the air, and the screen shattered, sending shards of glass flying in every direction. The characters screamed, a cacophony of rage and despair, as they were pulled back into the void from which they came. Silence fell over the room, the remnants of the shattered console flickering out like dying stars. I collapsed to the floor, gasping for breath, my heart pounding in my chest. The characters were gone, but the air still felt charged with their malevolence. Days passed, and I tried to return to normal life, but I could never shake the feeling of being watched. I threw away the remnants of the cursed console, but I could still hear the echoes of their laughter in the dark corners of my mind. I was a gamer, a lover of worlds beyond reality, but now I knew the truth: some games were never meant to be played. And as I lay in bed at night, the shadows flickering in the corners of my room, I couldn’t help but wonder—what if they weren’t gone? What if they were just waiting for the next player, the next unwitting soul to unleash their terror once more?",

Same with Natasha and as she was waiting for nick to arrive, her evil was turning some of the animals and even some people into other worldly creatures. There were men with guns and weapons to kill them, clearly both of them didn't want to get married but eventually both of them were brought together and married off. The marriage had strained their evil and they were both trapped with one and another, for both of them to divorce they would have to find a specific person to divorce them so that they could both spread their evil.",

      "content": "There is no such thing as something being cold or below zero. I mean if zero is nothing then how could something exist below something that is nothing? I have been on the hunt to prove that there is no such thing as cold. Yes I know there are fridges and our foods and stuff freeze when you put them in there, but we have got it wrong. I think our bodies and our minds do it when we think of cold and freezing. So I get someone and I put him into a big freezer, I tell him to not think of the cold. I had hoped that this guy of thinking of warmth, that it would get hotter. Unfortunately he died of being too cold and I couldn't believe it at all. Then as I was mourning his death and annoyed at how stupid I looked, I saw a female ghost from the 18th century. Then I started wondering how we never see ghosts from people that died in the year 2000 and onwards? I mean I should have seen the spirit of the guy who died in the freezer. I was still determined to prove myself right. I don't believe the cold exists but simply our collective minds do it and that the human race changes the weather and temperature, but the people that control us don't want us to know it. At the same time I've been annoyed at my own heart, for constantly repeating the same heart beat and I hate stuff that constantly repeats the same thing over and over again. So I get myself busy again and I find another guy who is willing to go into the big freezer. I know that I am right because how could there be something below zero? There is no such thing as the cold!! The second guy goes into the big freezer and he also dies of being too cold. I couldn't believe it at all and then I see another ghost from the 17th century. Again I wonder why we don't see ghosts of people who died in the year 2000 and onwards. Then as I am getting annoyed at my heart constantly repeating the same beat, I hate stuff that constantly repeats itself, I then realise that no one has ever seen a ghost of someone that has died from the year 2000 onwards. Then I decide to hang myself, I then wake up in some secret place and I also see the two guys who went into the freezer who were both alive. Then I get told that from the year 2000, the human race became immortal and that's why we don't see ghosts from people that died in the year 2000 onwards. There is a whole other city built deep into the earth.",

      "content": "They said the job would be easy. One form, one ID check, one elevator. No phones, no talking, no deviations. “Just follow the man in gray,” they said. The first time, I did everything by the book. The elevator doors opened with a soft mechanical hiss. Sterile walls. Fluorescent hum. A man in a plain gray uniform waited outside—expression neutral, like someone who’d been doing this for far too long. He didn’t speak. Just nodded and walked. We moved down a hallway that was almost too clean, too quiet. Like a hospital abandoned mid-shift. At the end was a thick window, behind which sat a guard. He didn’t look up when I approached, just pressed a button. A heavy magnetic lock clicked open beside me. Buzz. I stepped into the room. There was a file on the table. Labeled: TOP SECRET I don’t remember what I read. I never do. But when I came out, there was check waiting for me at the guard's window. My name. My silence. Bought clean. The gray-suited man walked me back to the elevator. He stood beside me, arms folded. And just before the doors closed… a second guard stepped out of the middle room. He raised his pistol and shot the attendant clean through the skull. No warning. No hesitation. The doors sealed. The elevator descended. I went back again the next week. Didn’t go in the room that time. Didn’t read the file. Didn’t ask questions. Still got paid. Still watched another gray-suited man get executed behind me. Same guard. Same routine. By the third visit, I’d stopped pretending I was uncomfortable. By the fifth, I stopped wondering why I was still going. This process went on for a several months, until finally they decided to promote me. Now I find myself holding a clipboard. This gray uniform fits better than I thought it would. The elevator’s rising. There’s someone new inside. And I think know what’s going to happen next.",

      "content": "In certain areas of rural Europe, usually where farmers have had a bad harvest and misfortune struck not only once, a tale of a starving fox occasionally appears. When chickens disappear at night without a trace, the few who remain refrain from walking outside ever again. When the smell of rot and iron fills the air, and the children hear a raspy voice from the woods calling to them, “Closer, child, you don’t have to be alone.” That’s when the tale of the starving fox creeps its way back into people's memories once again. Farmers speak of a fox whose ribcage resembles sickles poking through thin fabric. A fox whose hunger can never be satiated, always on the brink of starvation. A fox that’s calculated and picks its prey carefully. The fox’s hollow eyes lurk in the woods, observing the trails where children play. The farmers say that even in its famished state, it remains a sly fox. It lures children into the woods and breaks into chicken coops. All meat is the same to the starving fox. However, meat does not put an end to its hunger, and the prey’s blood turns to dust in its mouth. The fox knows its fate, forever in pain. But it is a fox, and foxes hunt. One particular prey fulfills the hunting desires more than others. The tale of the starving fox has disappeared and reappeared several times. But what has remained is an ever-adapting poem that old farmers still mutter to themselves as they work and pray that their chickens will be safe for the night. “With its broken jaw and tongue of bone The fox feasts on the fat of children and Later, grins by their gravestone. A fading figure, vile and forever famished Even God saw the thing and made it banished Be careful, children, stay close to your parents Or else maybe you will be the next one they say vanished With a rotten grin And skin so thin You can run, you can make haste But the starving fox will find you, and seal your fate”",

      "content": "“Der Schrei im Lehm” (“The Scream in the Clay”) By Gefreiter Karl Brecht – 1917 Discovered, Translated, and Annotated by Prof. Martin Weiss, University of Leipzig, 2025 [Introduction – Prof. Martin Weiss, 2025] In March 2025, while cataloging abandoned storage from the German War Archive, I uncovered a collection of unsorted belongings sealed in a rusted locker marked “Unprocessed: Trench Recovery, Verdun Sector – 1917.” Inside: uniforms, a rusted Luger pistol, a leather-bound journal — soaked in what appeared to be blood. It belonged to a soldier named Karl Brecht, whose name does not appear in any official battalion records. Yet the handwriting, the paper, the materials — all authentic to the Great War. I read the journal. And I have not slept for six days. You are about to read the most disturbing artifact I have ever encountered. It is not merely a record of war. It is a record of something beneath war. Something that should have remained buried. My advice: do not read this after dark. Do not read it alone. And when you are finished — do not read it twice. [The Journal of Gefreiter Karl Brecht – Verdun, March 1917] 2. März 1917 There are no birds here. Even in the silence between barrages, the sky remains still. No wind. No sound. Just the endless moan of the clay beneath our boots. We call this sector Der Fleischacker — “The Flesh Field.” The mud is red, but not from blood. It was red before we came. It bubbles at night. Sometimes we hear voices calling from under it. We tried to dig. Once. We stopped when we hit teeth. Not human teeth. Too many. 5. März 1917 Corporal Stein vanished last night. He was standing watch at the edge of Trench 14 when he went silent. No scream. No shot. Just gone. We followed his boot prints. They led to a shallow crater filled with thick, rust-colored mud. It was breathing. We didn’t tell command. We lied. Said he deserted. But I found his helmet this morning — wedged into the wall of the trench. There was skin stretched across the inside, like it had been growing there. There was a single word scratched inside the metal. “Hunger.” 7. März 1917 Something is wrong with our shadows. They don’t follow us properly. They twitch when we don’t move. Mine keeps facing the opposite direction. Private Holtz said he saw my shadow smile. He hanged himself in the latrine pit an hour later. I found a note in his boot. It said: “She is under the earth. She drinks our screams. When enough bones break, she will rise.” We burned the body. It screamed until it was ash. 11. März 1917 I don’t remember enlisting. I don’t remember where I was born. Or who my parents were. All I remember is this trench. And the song it sings at night. It’s not a real melody — more like bones cracking in rhythm. The mud joins in, gurgling like a throat half-full of blood. We sleep inside the noise now. We can’t sleep without it. There’s a man in the pit behind the trench. Not alive. Not dead. He wears a German uniform, but his chest is inside out. His mouth is filled with dirt and brass buttons. His eyes blink sideways. He told me: “You are not here to fight. You are here to feed.” 15. März 1917 – Letzter Eintrag Last night, the trench collapsed inward. Not from shellfire — it was pulled. The walls folded like meat and the ground opened its mouth. It whispered to us. It said, “I remember when there was no war. I was hungry then. But now… now I feast.” I saw my comrades sink into the clay. Not die — sink. As if the mud drank them slowly. Some didn’t scream. Some sang. Others begged for more. And I? I didn’t run. I wrote. Because the clay asked me to. It wants its story told. And when you finish reading this, you will start writing too. You’ll hear the mud call your name in the shower. In your dreams. In the silence between your heartbeats. This war never ends. Not here. Not below. She waits. And she is still so very hungry. [Final Reflections – Prof. Weiss, 2025] I burned the journal. It didn’t catch fire. It bled. I mailed the remnants to a colleague in Berlin. He died the next night in his sleep — face buried in soil, lungs full of gravel, nails embedded into his own scalp. His last email to me said: “Don’t dig near your house. Don’t go outside when it rains. And for God’s sake… stop humming that song.” My students say I speak in my sleep now. They say I murmur a woman’s name — one that isn’t German. One we can't translate. They say the air in my office smells like **wet iron and fresh graves You’ve read this now. It’s in you. It remembers you. When the ground shifts beneath your feet tonight — don’t look down. She’s already looking up.",

      "title": "The basement tenant",
      "content": "Lique and Rashad had just moved into their first home together — an older, slightly run-down rental, but perfect for their budget and quiet enough for the life they were building. A week in, Rashad joked that the place had “personality,” mostly because of the weird noises at night and how cold the basement always felt, even in the middle of summer. One day while organizing the garage, Lique found a second set of keys labeled “Basement access (owner only).” She thought it was odd since they’d already been in the basement to do laundry. When she asked the landlord about it, he quickly brushed it off with a mumbled, “Old locks, nothing to worry about.” Then strange things started happening. Lique would wake up to the washer running — but empty. Rashad swore he heard soft footsteps below them when they were in bed. Once, their dog refused to go down there and just growled at the basement door all night. Things escalated fast. Rashad came home early from work one afternoon to find the basement door wide open. Thinking Lique was down there, he called out. No answer. So he went down… and found nothing but the flickering laundry light and a strange, metallic smell in the air. Later that night, Lique told him she had been out all day. They finally decided to set up a camera near the basement stairs, half-laughing about it, half-not. The next morning, they checked the footage. At 3:17 a.m., the basement door creaked open. A figure crawled out on all fours thin, pale, wearing nothing but a stained Tshirt and boxers. He stood slowly, listening, then walked up to the second floor. For six full minutes, he stood silently over Lique and Rashad’s bed as they slept. Then he walked back down and disappeared into the basement. When they showed the footage to the police, the landlord was forced to speak. There was a crawlspace under the basement meant for old piping access but apparently a homeless man had lived down there for years, unnoticed, before the previous tenants moved out. The landlord thought he was gone when the place was cleaned out. But when police searched the crawlspace, it was empty again. Just a small mattress. A bag of raw meat. And dozens of Polaroid photos of Lique and Rashad sleeping. Each photo was labeled with the same word, written in shaky black marker: “MINE.”",

      "content": "My son is scared of white people even though we are white ourselves? I don't know what to do but he keeps screaming when he goes outside and sees a white person. The thing is though we are white ourselves, he doesn't scream at us or himself. We have all resigned to just stay at home and not go out, I have tried to reason with my son by making him realise that he is white himself. He wasn't like this but he became like this a year ago. I found him screaming outside at white people, I tried shouting back at him that he is white himself. Then my second son he has dreams of becoming 2 dimensional being. He doesn't want to be 3 dimensional anymore and he yearns to be 3 dimensional. He has stopped eating to achieve his 2 dimensional state. He has even started to get squeezed by people, to help him lose more weight. He goes to a special place where he will be squeezed for an hour, and as he is being squeezed in many different positions, his body is burning more weight. My second son is so skinny and his dreams of becoming a 2 dimensional being is becoming true. Then my first son he is just becoming more erratic as time goes by, he is becoming more erratic towards white people. I have shouted at him that we are white ourselves, and I have told him how he doesn't scream at us his own family for being white. I'm sick of not being able to go out anymore because of how he is going to react when he sees white people. I regret my sons existence at this point and I don't know what to do. Then there is my second son who is seriously determined to be a second dimensional being. He shows me everyday how he is close to being 2nd dimensional. I have tried to force feed my second son but then he cusses me out for ruining his plans of becoming a 2nd dimensional being. I can't afford real help for both my sons and I am stuck with this. My second son who hopes to 2nd dimensional one day, is going to extreme lengths to achieve it. Then when my first screamed at seeing white people outside, I begged my son to stop this nonsense and I showed him again that we are white ourselves. Then my eldest son said to me \"the reason I don't scream at you, mother and little brother is because we are green\"",

      "content": "It was supposed to be a thrill. Four high school friends. Two couples. Best friends since childhood. They were inseparable, bound by laughter, trust, and the wild kind of confidence that only teenagers seem to possess. One night, they dared each other to explore the long-abandoned high-rise on the city’s edge—a skyscraper left incomplete, now a concrete skeleton. They arrived at 11:47 PM. By midnight, they had made it to the 40th floor—a massive open hall with shattered windows overlooking the twilight skyline. It was breathtaking in the most eerie way. And that’s when Lia pulled out the Ouija board from her backpack. “It’s just a joke,” she grinned. Her boyfriend, Dev, smirked and agreed. “Let’s see who’s got guts.” But Mira froze. Her instincts screamed. “This is stupid. We shouldn’t.” Her boyfriend, Zayn, saw the fear in her eyes and stood by her. “We’re heading out,” he said, pulling Mira gently by the hand. “You two have fun talking to demons.” Dev laughed and waved them off. Lia lit a candle. The planchette began to move. Part 2: The Last Message Mira couldn’t sleep. Even after Zayn dropped her home and kissed her goodnight, her chest felt tight—like something unfinished was clawing at her from inside. She scrolled through her phone at 2:14 AM. Snaps from Lia and Dev. Short clips—grainy and jittery: Dev laughing in the dark. Lia whispering, “It’s moving on its own.” The last one: a blurry shot of Lia’s face as she whispered, “Did you hear that? Behind you—” Then nothing. Mira eventually drifted off, anxiety heavy in her bones. By sunrise, there were cops at her door. Her mother called her downstairs, pale and shaking. “We need to ask you about your friends,” the officer said. “Dev and Lia. They never came home. Their parents filed missing reports.” Mira’s blood turned to ice. “That’s impossible. They were with us until after midnight. They were texting me.” She unlocked her phone. “I have proof. They sent me Snaps.” But when she opened the app— “Lia is typing…” appeared at the bottom of her screen. The phone slipped from her hand and hit the floor with a hollow crack. Because below that message— A new snap had arrived. Sent after sunrise. From Lia.",

      "title": "The Room That Whispers Back",
      "content": "The Room That Whispers Back As told by J. R. Vale My name is J. R. Vale. I used to be a writer of horror fiction—novels, scripts, creepypastas like the one you're about to read. I understood fear. I thought I knew where to draw the line between fiction and reality. I was wrong. What you’re about to read isn’t a story. It’s a confession. It’s a warning. It’s the last thing I will ever write. If anything happens to me—if I vanish, or if you find this file in some digital dead-end—please burn it. Don’t share it. Delete every copy. The more people read it, the more power it has. Because this story… it feeds. The Room That Whispers Back They say when you're alone long enough, the silence starts talking. I didn’t believe it until I moved into Apartment 3C. It was cheap. Too cheap. But I was desperate—jobless, broke, barely holding onto reality after my sister vanished without a trace last fall. Nobody cared. “Adults go missing all the time,” the detective said, like that explained anything. But I knew she wouldn’t just disappear. Not like that. The landlord of 3C didn’t ask questions. He just gave me the key with a crooked smile and said, “If the walls talk, don’t answer.” I thought it was a joke. The first night was quiet. Too quiet. No creaks. No city noise. Just... stillness. As if the air was holding its breath. At 3:03 AM, I woke up choking—gasping for air. The room was ice-cold. The mirror on the dresser was fogged up from the inside. And written across it, backwards, was: “I see you.” I didn’t sleep. The next day, I tried to clean the mirror. No matter what I used—soap, bleach, even scraping it with a razor—the words stayed. Not smudged. Just… there. Etched into the glass but only visible at night. Every night after, more messages appeared. “Why didn’t you help her?” “She screamed for hours.” “You let her die.” I thought it was some cruel prank. Maybe someone hacked my phone, my apartment. I started locking everything. I sealed the mirror under blankets, but it didn’t matter. The words would bleed through. Then the whispering began. Low. Constant. Squelch. Squelch. Drip. Scrape. Laugh. Like a child giggling while something wet was being torn apart. On the sixth night, I found fingernail scratches behind the closet. Hundreds of them. As if someone had been buried alive in the wall. Then I saw her. My sister. She was standing in the corner of the room, her back to me. Her hair was wrong—too long, too tangled. Her arms were bent in ways that shouldn't be possible. But it was her face that broke me: stitched shut at the mouth. Her eyes were wide with pain, begging. Then she spoke—not with her mouth, but inside my head. “He fed me to the room.” I moved to destroy it—burn the room, tear it apart. But I was too late. I was part of it now. The room didn’t need bricks to trap you. It fed on guilt. On your guilt. Because deep down, I did let her die. I ignored her calls. I didn’t pick her up that night. She was scared, begging to come over. I was too busy. Too tired. The room took her pain and made it eternal. And now, it’s feeding on mine. I haven’t left 3C in months. Or maybe years. Time doesn’t work here anymore. Every second stretches, looping, until it snaps. There’s no day, no night—only the mirror, the scratching, and the whispers that never stop. Sometimes, the room lets me post online—little stories, fragments. To lure others. I think it feeds better when there are more eyes, more guilt, more screams echoing in the walls. So if you’re reading this, don’t come looking for me. You’ll find the room instead. And it’s hungry. If you think this is fiction—good. That means it hasn’t touched you yet. But if you hear it whisper when you're alone, if your mirror fogs up at 3:03 AM, if you see the words... don’t write back. Don’t answer the room. Because if you do… it remembers your name. And it never lets go.",

      "content": "Hi. English not first language, sorry for mistakes. I only want to post this before I delete account. Maybe someone smarter can explain. This happen 6 days ago on a post in r/TrueCrimeDiscussion. It was a thread about a girl gone missing in 2017. I comment something normal, nothing crazy, just a theory about the timeline. It got like 400+ upvotes. I was happy. But then one user replied. His username was something like you/LURK___3AM. He say something weird like: \"She wasn’t the first. Check behind the church bell. The silence is proof.\" At first I thought it was joke. Or someone larping. But I reply anyway, I ask \"what do you mean?\" He didn’t respond again. I check his profile out of curiosity. It was new—only 1 post, 2 comments, including mine. The one post he had? It was in a subreddit I never saw before. Called r/LeftUnfound. I clicked it. Subreddit doesn’t exist. I even typed it again manually. Nothing. Dead link. I go back to his account, refresh — \"user deleted.\" Everything gone. Now the creepy part: That night, I got a message. Not Reddit DM. Email. To my personal Gmail. Subject: “She wasn’t the first.” No message body. Just that subject. I swear to god, I never link my email to Reddit. I use fake username, VPN, everything. No idea how someone would find it. I ignored it. Thought maybe troll. Then yesterday, someone send link to me. A local newspaper article. Small one, not big news. A man found dead behind an old church, outside of town. They say no ID. He had no wallet, no phone. Just a small bell in his hand. No one else connected it. But the church? It’s real. It’s in my city. I Google it. It has a bell tower. And his picture… blurry… but it could be him. The guy from the profile photo. The one who commented on my post. I deleted the post now. I don’t want to be part of this. But there’s more. Someone replied to my new comment today. Different post. New account. Username: you/ReturnToBell They wrote: “Now you’re part of it.” I’m logging out. If this post get deleted or I disappear… Check the bell.",

      "title": "The Johnsons",
      "content": "The Johnsons By creepypastaclassics The hum started when I moved to the small town of Ashwick, a place so quiant you could hear your own thoughts echo. It wasn’t a sound, not exactly—just a pressure in my mind, like a whisper I couldn’t quite catch. I chalked it up to the move, the stress of starting over in a place where everyone seemed to know each other. But then I met the Johnsons. They weren’t a family in the way you’d think. Not a single household with a picket fence, but a sprawling network of cousins, aunts, uncles, and in-laws that seemed to touch every corner of Ashbury. The barista at the coffee shop was a Johnson. The postman was a Johnson. The woman who smiled at me from the pew across the church aisle, her eyes lingering too long—she was a Johnson too. They were everywhere, woven into the town like threads in a quilt, and they all had that same look: warm, welcoming, but with an edge, like they knew something I didn’t. It started with small things. Invitations to Sunday dinners at one of their homes, where the food was always perfect, the conversation always… directed. They’d ask about my past, my dreams, my fears, their questions so precise it felt like they were mapping my soul. I’d leave those dinners feeling lighter, like I’d unburdened myself, but also hollow, like I’d given something away I couldn’t name. Then the patterns emerged. My landlord, a Johnson, always seemed to know when I was struggling with rent before I said a word. A check would arrive, unsigned, with a note: “From the Kin.” My coworker, another Johnson, would finish my sentences, laugh at jokes I hadn’t told. The town’s librarian, a gray-haired Johnson with eyes like polished glass, handed me books I hadn’t asked for—self-help tomes, obscure philosophy, journals filled with handwritten notes about “belonging” and “the greater whole.” I’d find myself reading them late at night, the hum in my mind growing louder, more coherent, like a voice urging me to join. I tried to pull back. I stopped going to their dinners, ignored their calls. But the Johnsons didn’t push. They waited. And that was worse. The hum became a chorus, a rhythm that pulsed in my thoughts, shaping them. I’d catch myself humming their songs—old folk tunes I’d never heard before. I’d dream of their faces, their smiles, their hands reaching out, not to grab me but to guide me. In the dreams, I wasn’t alone. I was part of something vast, a family that stretched beyond Ashwick, beyond time, all connected by a single, unbreakable will. I confided in a friend from out of town, Sarah, over the phone. She laughed it off, said I was paranoid. But the next day, she texted me a photo: her standing next to a woman who looked just like the librarian, both smiling. The caption read, “Met your cousin! She’s a Johnson too.” Sarah stopped answering my calls after that. I went to the police, but the sheriff was a Johnson. He listened patiently, nodding, his smile never wavering. “You’re just feeling the weight of being alone,” he said. “We can fix that. You’re already one of us, you know.” I ran from the station, heart pounding, the hum so loud it drowned out my own thoughts. I started noticing the gaps. Memories that didn’t add up. I’d find photos in my apartment of me at Johnson gatherings I didn’t remember attending, my face beaming, my arm around people I didn’t know. My journal, which I kept locked, had new entries in my handwriting: “I’m home. I’m whole. I’m Kin.” My dreams weren’t dreams anymore—they were instructions. Step by step, thought by thought, the Johnsons were rewriting me. I tried to leave Ashwick. Packed a bag, got in my car. But every road looped back to the town square, where a crowd of Johnsons stood waiting, their faces serene, their eyes locked on me. They didn’t speak. They didn’t need to. The hum did it for them, a melody that sank into my bones, telling me I wasn’t leaving. I was arriving. I’m writing this from a diner on the edge of town, the only place I can think clearly, though the hum is still there, soft and insistent. The waitress, a Johnson, keeps refilling my coffee without asking. She’s humming, and I realize it’s the same tune I’ve been hearing in my head. My hands shake as I type, not from fear but from something worse—recognition. The hum isn’t just in me. It is me. My thoughts, my choices, my life—they’ve all been shaped, not by force but by a gentle, relentless pull, like a tide wearing down a stone. If you’re reading this, you’ve already met them. The coworker who knows too much. The neighbor who’s too kind. The stranger whose smile makes your skin crawl, not because it’s wrong but because it’s right. They’re not a cult. They’re a family. And they want you to come home. The hum is louder now. It’s not a sound. It’s a name. Johnson. And I’m starting to forget why I ever wanted to fight it",

      "title": "The Silence That Took Me",
      "content": "The Silence That Took Me By terrible020 It started with a curious conversation. It was just a conversation, at a coffee shop with some friends. We were laughing, trading stories about work, bad dates, the usual stuff. But then, mid-sentence, I realized I had nothing left to say. Nothing. My mind went blank, like a radio losing signal. Flatlined. I tried to grab onto a thought—any thought—but there was nothing. Just static. And nothing. I smiled, nodded, and sipped my coffee to cover it up. My friends didn’t notice. They kept chatting, their voices blending into a dull hum. I stared at the table, at the grain of the wood, and felt myself… slip. Not physically, but like my mind was a kite cut loose, drifting away. I was still there, but I wasn’t. I was zoning out, further than I’d ever gone before. Panicking. That was the first time. It kept on happening. At work, I’d sit in meetings, watching lips move, hearing words but not processing anything. I’d try to speak, to contribute, but my thoughts were empty. I’d stare at my computer screen, the cursor blinking, mocking me, laughing at me. Emails went unanswered. My boss asked if I was okay, and I said, “Yeah, just tired.” But I wasn’t tired. I was gone. At home, things got worse. I’d sit on the couch, TV on, but the screen was just colors and noise. I’d scroll my phone, but the posts, the memes, the news—they meant nothing. I’d open my mouth to call a friend, to say something, but no words came. It was like my voice had been stolen, not by force, but by absence. Like it had slipped into the same void where my thoughts went. One night, I looked in the mirror, and I didn’t recognize myself. Not my face—it was still me, same eyes, same nose. But the spark was gone. My eyes were empty, like windows to a house no one lived in. I tried to say my name, to anchor myself, but my lips wouldn’t move. The silence was heavy, pressing against my chest, filling the room. That’s when I heard it. A whisper, not from outside, but from inside my head. It wasn’t words, not exactly—just a low, constant murmur, like a crowd talking too far away to make out. It wasn’t threatening, but it wasn’t friendly either. It was… indifferent. Like it didn’t care if I listened or not. But it was there, always, filling the space where my thoughts used to be. I stopped going out. Friends texted, called, left voicemails. “Where are you? You okay?” I wanted to answer, but my fingers wouldn’t type, my voice wouldn’t come. The texts piled up, unread. The world kept moving, but I was stuck, sinking deeper into the silence. One night, I sat in my apartment, lights off, staring at the wall. The murmur in my head was louder now, not words but a presence, like something was sitting in the room with me. I felt it watching, not with eyes, but with attention. I tried to scream, to break the silence, but my throat was dry, my voice gone. The air felt thick, like it was pressing me down, swallowing me. I don’t know when it happened, but at some point, I wasn’t in my apartment anymore. I was nowhere. Not a place, not a void—just… nothing. I could still see, still think, but it wasn’t me doing it. It was like I was a passenger in my own body, watching from far away. My hands moved, but I wasn’t moving them. My mouth spoke, but I wasn’t speaking. Someone—or something—was living my life, wearing my skin. I saw it through my own eyes, like a movie I couldn’t turn off. It went to my job, smiled at my coworkers, answered emails. It met my friends, laughed at their jokes, told stories I didn’t remember living. They didn’t notice anything wrong. To them, it was me. But I was gone, trapped in the silence, watching from the void. Sometimes, I try to fight, to claw my way back. I scream, but no one hears. I reach for my thoughts, but they slip through my fingers like smoke. The murmur is always there, louder now, drowning out what’s left of me. It’s not cruel, not kind—it just is. And every day, I feel myself fade a little more, like a signal growing weaker. I don’t know what it wants. I don’t know if it’s a thing, a force, or just… what happens when you run out of things to say. But I know this: it’s not just me. I see it in others now, in the empty eyes of strangers on the street, in the hollow laughs at crowded bars. They’re zoning out, slipping away, and something else is stepping in. If you’re reading this, listen. If you ever feel your words dry up, your thoughts go quiet, don’t let it take you. Fight. Say something, anything, even if it’s nonsense. Hold onto your voice, your spark, because once it’s gone, you’re not just silent. You’re erased. And the silence is hungry.",

      "content": "I started keeping a journal on my phone. Just a simple note file titled “MindCheck.” My therapist recommended it to track memory slips and mood swings. I’ve been having more foggy moments lately—walking into a room and forgetting why, losing track of time, that kind of thing. At first, the entries were harmless. March 29 – Slept six hours. Vivid dream about a hallway with no doors. Fed the cat. Forgot to eat breakfast. April 1 – Walked into the kitchen, forgot why. Still tired. Felt like someone said my name but no one was there. Nothing unusual. But then came April 2: Who moved the hallway chair? It’s facing the wall. Pretty sure I didn’t do that. I stopped. I didn’t remember writing that. And I definitely didn’t move the chair. I got up to check—it was facing the wall. Just sitting there, like someone had turned it to watch the blank paint. I live alone. I brushed it off. Maybe I was half-asleep. Maybe I bumped it. Then came April 3: The man in the kitchen isn’t real. Repeat until it’s true. That one made my chest tighten. I don’t talk like that. I don’t write like that. It was timestamped at 3:12 a.m. I checked my phone’s activity logs. I hadn’t used it at that time. I even reviewed my home security footage—everything looked normal... except for one skipped frame around 3:12. Just a single flicker of static. Then back to normal. April 4: You’re doing good. You’re almost ready to remember. That entry felt wrong. Like it was trying to reassure me—but not for me. More like it was monitoring me. Watching. I took screenshots and planned to show someone. But when I opened the note app yesterday, everything was different. The file wasn’t called “MindCheck” anymore. It had been renamed: “Reintegration Logs.” All my entries had been rewritten. Every single one. They now started with: SUBJECT 42-B — Integration Progress: Day 3 False self still in control. Host unaware of secondary imprint. “False self.” “Host.” I stared at the screen, waiting to wake up. Then I scrolled down to today’s date. April 6 was already filled out: Host identity reading this now. Proceed with Phase 2. If confusion persists, initiate awareness collapse. Activate mirror trigger. There was one more line being typed, in real time: Stand up. Turn around. Look in the mirror. He’s been watching you write this. I haven’t looked. I won’t. But now, something new is typing itself: “I Don’t Remember Writing This.” Perfect. They always believe the scared ones. Proceed to Step 3. That wasn’t me. At least... I don’t think it was. If this post uploads on its own— don’t believe what I write after this.",

      "content": "It started with a noise—a low, wet scraping, like flesh dragging against wood. I lived alone in a creaky, ancient apartment building in a forgotten corner of the city. The kind of place with thin walls and stories no one tells out loud. I’d been there six months, and until that night, nothing unusual had happened. Then I noticed a door in the hallway. A door that wasn't there before. It was between my bedroom and bathroom, squeezed into a space too narrow for anything but wall. The door was pale, bloated, almost pulsing. It had no knob—just a slit where the wood looked torn, or chewed. I touched it. It exhaled. Inside was pitch black. But not the ordinary dark—it drank the light. I held my phone flashlight up, but the beam stopped an inch past the threshold like the shadows bit into it. Then the voices started. Not speech—mimicry. My mother’s voice, though she’d been dead for years. My own voice, laughing. Then crying. Then screaming. I should have closed the door. I went in instead. The air was thick. Not musty, not stale—organic. Like lungs full of tar. I walked forward, but the space stretched—forever, sideways, spiraling. The walls pulsed like meat. Something watched. Not from in front of me—but inside me. Then I saw it. Not a creature—a shape, born from memories I'd forgotten. My childhood dog with no eyes, hanging from a ceiling hook. My third-grade teacher, her jaw unhinged, whispering answers I never asked. My own face, sewn to a mannequin, twitching in silence. They moved like puppets without strings. And they knew me. Called me by my thoughts. Showed me things I'd buried: a time I let a boy drown. The kitten I crushed under my bike tire when I was six. The lie that killed my sister. They laughed. Not with joy—with familiarity. I tried to run but had no legs. I tried to scream but had no mouth. The room swallowed identity like breath underwater. It did not want me dead. It wanted me unmade. Then came the mirror. It stood on rotting legs, its surface smeared with handprints on the inside. I looked—and I saw not myself, but what I would become: a husk, repeating every lie I’d ever told, forever. Trapped in a loop of guilt and horror. A puppet whose strings were regret. That was the punishment. It wasn’t a room. It was a confession box built by a god who only believed in punishment. I don’t remember leaving. I only remember waking in my bed, the door gone. But it left something behind. A sound, always just behind the wall. A voice, humming lullabies in my dead grandmother’s voice. A face in mirrors—mine, but smiling when I am not. And sometimes, when I blink, I see it again. The bloated door. Waiting. And I know that one day, I’ll open it again. Because it remembers me. And it’s hungry.",

      "content": "The clockmaker lived alone, in a cottage filled with ticking hearts. Dozens of clocks lined the walls, from ornate grandfather clocks to tiny pocket watches, each singing its own rhythm of time’s passing. But none of them mattered now. He had once loved time. He had measured it, respected it, worshiped it like a god he could almost touch. After fifty years of crafting and mending, his hands grown calloused and mind sharpened like a pendulum’s swing, he did the impossible—he built a device that could breach time’s veil. It looked so simple. A brass dial, a humming coil, a switch that glowed faintly blue. He had called it The Gentle Hour. The first time he used it, he wept. He stood in his boyhood home and watched his mother sing. He blinked, and he was in the war, young again, terrified. Another blink, and he saw the moment he first opened his shop. But something went wrong. He can’t remember the moment of the explosion—only the deafening ring, the smell of scorched copper, and a flash of white. He had torn time, but instead of moving through it, he had become trapped within a single hour. Forever 3:17 p.m., October 11th. Leaves always falling. The same wind always brushing past his window. The same knock on the door he never answers, because he knows who it is—himself. Every day, he watches his past self reach for the device. Every day, he tries to stop it, screaming, breaking clocks, smashing glass—but the loop resets before anything changes. The world returns. The tick begins again. He does not age. He does not sleep. Time wraps around him like a noose that never tightens. He has torn pages from books, carved symbols into walls, tried fire, drowning, silence. Nothing sticks. He wakes up every cycle in the same chair, with the same cup of cold tea beside him. And worst of all—he remembers. Perfectly. Every second. Every repetition. He is a man trapped in amber, fully conscious, fully aware, endlessly circling the moment he ruined everything. Once, he thought he could fix it. He rewired the machine a thousand times, adjusted gears, changed settings, replaced crystals. But the loop only laughed. It played him like a melody on repeat. He has seen madness. He has begged time itself. He has cursed gods, built shrines, torn them down. The clocks mock him now, all striking different hours—none of them real. Sometimes, he wonders if this is penance. For tampering with what should never be touched. For daring to believe he could master time, when he was only ever its servant. Now he waits for something—he no longer knows what. A crack in the loop. A merciful error. An end. But the hour hand never moves. And in the quiet cottage, among ticking ghosts, the clockmaker remains. A prisoner of his own design. A regret that cannot die.",

      "content": "In the crooked town of Grimwick, where streetlamps flickered like dying stars and fog clung to cobblestones like a lover’s grudge, Sheila and Jimmy John were the darling duo of Maple Street. Sheila, with her raven hair twisted in spirals and eyes sharp as a switchblade, baked pies that made the neighbors swoon. Jimmy John, lanky as a scarecrow with a grin that could charm a snake, fixed bicycles for every kid in town. They were sweet as molasses, always holding hands, whispering secrets, and giggling over private jokes. But beneath their pastel veneer, a darkness festered, hungry for chaos. One moonless night, over a bottle of cheap whiskey in their creaky Victorian, Sheila leaned close, her lips brushing Jimmy’s ear. “I’m bored of pies and smiles. Let’s take something. Something big.” Jimmy’s grin widened, his teeth glinting like a jack-o’-lantern’s. “The bank, sugar. We’ll bleed it dry.” Their laughter was a jagged melody, and by dawn, they were no longer the friendly couple but wolves in vintage clothes, plotting with a sadistic gleam. They stormed Grimwick Savings at noon, faces painted like porcelain dolls, all cracked smiles and hollow eyes. Sheila waved a pistol, her voice a sugary snarl. “Hands up, or I repaint this place red.” Jimmy, clutching a shotgun, cackled as he stuffed cash into a burlap sack. A teller, trembling, whispered, “You’re monsters.” Sheila winked, her fingers miming a handjob in mockery. “Only on weekends, darling.” The vault groaned open, spilling wealth, but their joy was cruel, their eyes alight with a madness that chilled the air. They fled to the woods, cash trailing like confetti, their laughter echoing through gnarled trees. In a derelict cabin, they counted their haul, drunk on power. Sheila straddled Jimmy, her nails raking his chest. “We’re gods now,” she purred, offering a handjob as reward for their sin. But the cabin creaked, shadows twisting on the walls. Footsteps thudded outside, heavy, unnatural. Jimmy’s grin faltered. “Sheila, you hear that?” She froze, her breath a hiss. The door splintered, revealing nothing but darkness, yet it moved, alive, seeping inside. The shadows weren’t shadows. They were hands, clawing, eyeless, mouths gaping with silent screams. They dragged Sheila first, her shrieks swallowed as she vanished into the void. Jimmy scrambled back, sobbing, but the hands seized him, cold as death, pulling him toward a maw of endless night. The last sound was the sack of cash spilling, coins clinking like a dirge. Grimwick never spoke of Sheila and Jimmy John again, but on moonless nights, the woods whispered their names, and the bank’s walls bled black.",

Then I kept trying to photocopy my face and my face wouldn't be printed out on the paper but some other guys face. What came printing out from the printer, was a sad looking face who looked really boring and someone didn't lead a fun life. It looked depressing and then I told someone about it and showed them what I was experiencing, they then photocopied their own face. They experienced the very same thing and what came out on paper, was another depressing sad looking face. Then my sister called me and she told me that she is 7 months pregnant. I was confused because she has no baby bump and shows no signs of being pregnant. Then my sister said that the reason she is showing no signs of pregnancy, is because her baby inside her womb has no body or organs. Her husband has a condition which is whenever he gets someone pregnant, the unborn baby will have no body or organs. My sister is excited an so is her husband. I was still more concerned with the printer thing though. I went to the printer at work and photocopied my face but still, whenever the paper came out it didn't show my face but some other face. Then as more workers figured out about what the printer was doing, they tried it themselves. No matter what they looked like, what came out of the printer was a depressing looking man's face. Some of the women started to become scared and hysterical, and they hated the printer for not printing out what they looked like. Then I kept photo copying my face, and when I observed what the printer had printed out, I concentrated on the sadness and suffering. Then word went round that all of the printers in the building were printing the same sad looking face, whenever someone photocopied their face. One guy who photo copied his ass had become hysterical, when the printer still printed out someone else's ass. Then my sister called telling me that her baby with no body or organs, is due to be born. Her husband was going to take her to a special place for such babies to be born. Then her husband called me after a couple of hours and he said \"your sister is dead and I have taken her organs\" and he also told me where her body was. I then retrieved my dead sister and when I photo copied her face on the printer, her face was actually on the paper when it printed out.",

      "content": "I hate awkward silences and when I find myself close to an awkward silence, I must destroy it. Even when I am eating alone, if I am sitting next to a couple who are just sitting there not talking to each other, that awkward silence just kills me. I try my best not to be antagonised by the awkward silence between that couple, then I just get up and I scream at that couple for not talking to each other and creating an awkward silence. I start doing crazy stuff like throwing the table around to get them to talk. Then I walk off and when I get home, I go straight to bed. Then when I wake up in the morning I find that my right arm has been trafficked. It's no longer on my body and I miss it so much. I wonder what my right arm is being forced to do and I want it attached back to my body. It so hard just having a left arm and I'm not left handed, so everything is so much more harder. I'm just so worried sick for my right arm and I wonder what it's doing right now. Then as I go outside I sense an awkward silence straight away. It's another couple in a Cafe and then are just drinking coffee but aren't speaking to each other. The awkward silence emanating from those two is piercing me like a sharp knife. They are just sipping coffee and not saying a word to each other. I walk up to their table and I just start to scream at them. I lift their table and throw it to the ground, I had hoped my craziness would get them talking. They were just stunned and then I see another couple who were just walking silently, I run up to them and just scream. I hoped fear would get the Couples talking and I do whatever it takes to kill an awkward silence. An awkward silence is just like harmful radiation that can pierce through bodies and do so much damage. At home I'm just worried sick about my right arm that had been trafficked somewhere. I wonder what it's doing and then in the morning, my right is back being attached to my body. I was so happy but I could sense that my right arm has been through hell. Then when I see another couple just sitting together and not talking, I go up to them and I start to scream. I also start to chop off my arm to kill the awkward silence.",

      "title": "Lorraine, Are you There?",
      "content": "*March 17th, 2002 The sleepy little Florida community of Wilford Springs was visited upon by a devastation of ghastly proportions yesterday when a drifter, 61 year old Satchel Crittendon, was taken into custody for the savage murder and cannibalization of 42 year old Thomas Ivory. Ivory-a local pharmacist and bachelor- was discovered in the basement of his home on Pine street after Crittendon was reportedly spotted by a neighbor wandering the street with his face and hands covered in what would be later identified as Ivory’s coagulated blood. What unfolds next makes this unsettling story even more bizarre: while in custody Crittendon claims to have been coerced by Ivory into joining him for ham sandwiches earlier that week, where he was drugged and later awoke tied up in the basement. According to the drifter, while in captivity, Ivory taunted and sexually teased him with a Halloween mask and dress resembling that of an elderly woman that Ivory referred to as ‘Lorraine’. After days Crittendon says he managed to break free and in a “fit of malnourished and dehydrated rage” viciously attacked Ivory, chewing out his jugular vein. Afterward Crittendon commenced eating other various parts of Ivory, including his eyes, tongue, fingers and penis. Those who have reached out to the authorities claiming to have known Cirittendon all concede to his history of mental illness, but no violent crimes have yet to be found on record. Upon further investigation local authorities did discover a variety of sleep medications, rope, and other items of interest throughout Ivory’s residence, but found no trace of an elderly woman mask or dress, thus leading to serious doubts of a so-called Lorraine persona invented by Ivory. “We are just plain dubious about Lorraine,” Sheriff Winsmore stated to the press this morning. “But one thing is for certain, something dang weird definitely transpired in that house, and I don’t know if we’ll ever quite understand the mess.” This story will be updated as further details emerge.",

      "content": "Travis squatted beside the last stubborn boulder, sweat trickling into his eyes. Kim’s “flower garden” was more like a chaotic ring of weeds and stone, a patchwork border of mismatched rocks that looked dragged from a dozen gravel piles. Most were small enough to toss aside, but this one… “I think we hit bedrock,” Travis groaned, wedging the pry bar deeper beneath the exposed edge. Kim laughed from the porch, sipping sweet tea. “Don’t wimp out on me now. You’re the muscle.” He grunted and leaned in. Inch by inch, the earth gave way, and the true size of the stone revealed itself — a near-perfect sphere buried like a secret. It was at least two feet wide, much heavier than it looked. They wrestled it free together, gasping as it thudded into the grass with a hollow thunk. Travis hosed off the dirt and moss. As the grime slid away, the color stopped them both cold. Swirling veins of gold and blood-red shimmered across its polished surface. Purple flecks glittered like crushed gemstones. The patterns didn’t seem random — they spiraled, circled, almost moved as you stared at them. The rock was heavy but unnaturally smooth, like it had been carved, shaped, or grown. “Damn,” Travis muttered. “This… isn’t normal.” Kim knelt beside it. “It’s beautiful.” They took pictures, joked about calling a museum, and eventually rolled it into the garage, resting it on a pile of old moving blankets. Then they went to bed. But Travis couldn’t sleep. The swirls had burned into his vision. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw them twisting, tightening, drawing him inward like a whirlpool. He tried distracting himself — checked his phone, watched TV on mute, counted backwards from 100. No use. His chest was tight. His skin tingled. A question looped endlessly in his head: What’s inside it? At 2:13 AM, he gave in. Slipping out of bed like a guilty child, he padded down to the garage. The light buzzed on, casting a harsh glow on the object of his obsession. It sat like a relic, humming with unspoken promise. He circled it. Knelt. Ran a finger along the cool, gleaming ridges. “It has to be hollow,” he whispered. “It has to be something.” He grabbed the sledgehammer from the wall. Hands trembling, he lifted it over his shoulder and stared at the stone, breathing heavily. “Last chance to stay pretty.” He swung. The hammer struck with a deafening crack. The stone didn’t shatter. But its surface fractured, spiderweb lines racing across its shell in intricate, pulsing geometry. From deep within, a green glow surged outward — not just light, but life. A sickly, phosphorescent hue like rotting limes and decay. It didn’t reflect — it emanated. The air hissed, sharp and sour, like ozone mixed with spoiled meat. Travis stumbled back. The cracks widened. The swirls began to move — literally move — rotating around the glowing core, slow and deliberate, as if waking from an ancient slumber. The veins throbbed. The glow grew brighter. Then came the sound. Ticking. Not mechanical. Organic. Like bones clicking in sequence. Like something… stretching. The garage light exploded overhead. Total darkness. Except for the stone, which now pulsed like a heartbeat. And then it breathed. A long, rattling exhale hissed from the core. Warm. Wet. Travis dropped the hammer and turned to run. Behind him, the boulder split down the center with a low, wet crunch. And something stepped out.",

      "content": "Everyone thinks they know The Fairly OddParents, but there's one episode that never made it past the censors. I was an intern at Nickelodeon Animation Studio in 2004 when I found it, mislabeled in a folder of rough animations. The file name was just \"WISH\\INCIDENT\\DO\\NOT\\AIR.mp4\" It started normally enough. Timmy was having another bad day at school - typical stuff. But something was off about the animation. The colors were too sharp, the movements too jerky. When Timmy spoke, his voice had this slight echo, like it was being played in an empty room. \"I wish everyone would stop laughing at me,\" he said to Cosmo and Wanda. His tone wasn't angry or frustrated. It was... empty. Cosmo, being Cosmo, raised his wand before Wanda could stop him. \"One laugh-free wish coming up!\" The magic sparkle wasn't its usual golden yellow. It was red. At first, nothing seemed to happen. But then Francis, the school bully, walked past. He opened his mouth to laugh at Timmy, but no sound came out. His eyes went wide with panic as he clutched his throat. The animation became unsettlingly detailed as Francis's face turned blue. He collapsed, gasping silently. \"Cosmo, what did you do?\" Wanda's voice shook with horror. \"I just... I just made it so they couldn't laugh at Timmy anymore,\" Cosmo whispered, his usual cheerful demeanor cracking. The scene cut to the school cafeteria. Chester tried to tell a joke, but as soon as he started to laugh, he began choking. AJ rushed to help but suffered the same fate. One by one, every kid who tried to laugh fell silent, their faces contorting in increasingly realistic detail. \"Sport, we have to undo this wish!\" Wanda cried. \"But they're not laughing at me anymore,\" Timmy said, his voice still eerily calm. \"Isn't this what I wanted?\" The camera zoomed in on Timmy's face. His eyes were different - empty, like he was looking at something far away. \"All those times they laughed. All those jokes. Maybe it's funny now.\" The scene cut to mister. Crocker's classroom. He was about to make one of his usual \"FAIRY GODPARENTS!\" proclamations, but instead of shouting, he started making horrible gagging sounds. The animation showed every detail of his face as he struggled to breathe. \"Timmy, please!\" Wanda begged. \"This isn't right!\" But Timmy just watched, that empty look still in his eyes. \"You know what's funny, guys? I can still laugh.\" And he did. He laughed as the school descended into silent chaos. He laughed as Principal Waxelplax collapsed at her desk. He laughed as his parents tried to call for help but couldn't make a sound. The animation quality kept shifting between the normal cartoon style and something more realistic, more disturbing. You could see every detail of their suffering. Cosmo's wand began to crack. \"The magic... it's too dark. It's changing us!\" Wanda tried to raise her wand to undo the wish, but she started choking too. Fairy magic was tied to laughter, to joy. Without it, they were fading. \"Timmy,\" Cosmo gasped, his usually bright green color turning grey. \"What have we done?\" The final scene showed Timmy sitting alone in his room, surrounded by silence. His godparents were gone - their wands lying broken on the floor. Through his window, you could see Dimmsdale had become a ghost town. He turned to the camera, that empty smile still on his face. \"At least no one's laughing anymore.\" The screen went black, but not before showing one last image: Da Rules book, its pages torn and burning, with new words forming on the cover in red: \"Be Careful What You Wish For.\" After watching it, I tried to delete the file, but it wouldn't let me. Every copy I made appeared in a different folder on my computer. Sometimes late at night, I hear children laughing outside my window. But when I look, there's only silence. And sometimes, when something funny happens, I feel a tightness in my throat. Like something doesn't want me to laugh. I wonder if Timmy's still out there, in that silent world he created. Still smiling. Still the only one who can laugh. But mostly, I wonder if he regrets his wish. I know I regret watching it.",

      "content": "It started with a man named Elias Kerr. He was an audio engineer in the late 1980s—obsessed with sound. Not music. Not voices. Just sound—pure, raw, layered. Frequencies we don’t hear. Frequencies we’re not supposed to. He worked out of a small studio in Boston, testing homemade recorders and microphones sensitive enough to pick up insect wingbeats, tectonic shifts, even distant stars if you believed the rumors. He built one prototype he never shared with anyone—an experimental digital recorder with something called “resonance capture.” His journal was found years later, scorched and water-damaged. Only fragments remained. But one entry was mostly intact: “Captured something tonight. Below 20Hz. Room went cold. Voice not in the room, but… felt inside my spine. I asked if it was real. It answered.” “It said, ‘Now that you’ve heard me… I’m yours.’” After that, Elias stopped going out. People said he looked like he hadn’t slept in weeks. Neighbors reported strange sounds at night—low frequencies that rattled windows. Dogs wouldn’t go near the house. Then one day, the police were called. No signs of a break-in. No Elias. Just a scorched desk, a melted recorder, and a single USB flash drive sitting in a dish of salt water. It contained one audio file. Name: REC000.wav It was exactly 3:17 minutes long. The timestamp had no date. Just a message: “This is where it begins.” Since then, no one knows how the files spread. Maybe the recorder rebuilt itself. Maybe people made copies without realizing it. But the voices? They always say the same thing. “He’s watching you, just like he watched me.” And if you listen closely to the earliest recordings, deep in the background… …you can still hear Elias. Screaming.",

      "content": "\"I am the Witness, the one who sees what others wished were fake. There is something strange happening, something stranger than normal, I'll let the tale speak for itself.\" President Eric Potentia hadn’t slept in days. The Oval Office reeked of stale coffee and a odd scorched smell that didn’t seem to come from anywhere. Reports littered the desk—slashed livestock, mangled hikers, blackout zones spreading across rural towns. Each stamped with a red Exorcists seal, each dismissed publicly as \"animal attacks\" or \"equipment failure.\" But Eric knew better. He'd founded the Exorcists to contain what the world wasn’t ready to understand. And now, something was breaching those fragile boundaries. Something organized. “Sir,” came a voice from the shadows. doctor. Evelyn Harrow stepped into the warm gold light of a desk lamp. Her voice calm. Always calm. Eric looked up, eyes rimmed red. “They’re calling it a colony. But they’re not just nesting. They’re conquering.” Evelyn slid a dossier across the desk. “We’ve confirmed Werebeasts. Werewolves, primarily. But others too. A new type—classified as Lepus Rex Mutata. Civilians call it the Werehare. Massive. Bipedal. Strong enough to tear steel. No regression. No humanity.” Eric opened the file. A grainy night photo showed a silhouette in a snowy field—rabbit-like ears, barrel chest, talons soaked in blood, eyes that gleamed like polished dark, eyes beady like a shark's. “It doesn’t change back?” “It doesn’t want to,” she replied. He leaned back in his chair. “And they’re coordinated.” Evelyn nodded. “More than instinct. More than territory. They’re hunting with purpose. Hitting generators. Communications. Patterns like they’re being...directed.” Eric’s eyes narrowed. “By what?” She didn’t answer. Two nights later, Air Force One descended into a no-man’s land in Montana. Eric wore body armor beneath his suit. Beside him stood Special Agent Marcus Reyes, head of Field Ops, and a contingent of Exorcists armed with modified tranquilizers and silver-core ammunition. The sun dipped below the mountains in a blaze of orange. A single tree nearby had shed its leaves in a shape reminiscent of a missile. They drove through the dead town of Ashburn Hollow. Doors hung open. Blood smeared across walls. A child's wind-up toy was impaled by a pencil. From a butcher’s shop window, a fox-faced Werebeast watched them pass. It didn’t attack. It simply nodded. “They’re not running,” Reyes said. “They’re waiting.” That night, under electric floodlights, they made contact. The colony descended like a tide. Wolves, stags, bears, and beasts in-between—once-human bodies warped with muscle and fur. Their howls split the air, but they didn’t charge. They flanked. “Cover the perimeter!” Reyes shouted. Gunfire erupted. Silver rounds tore through fur and flesh. A wereboar slammed into a Humvee, flipping it. A wereowl darted down, claws dragging an agent into the dark. Then the Werehare arrived. It crashed through a barricade like a wrecking ball. Eight feet tall, ears twitching. It roared, a sound not unlike laughter mixed with a death rattle. Agents opened fire. It didn't stop. It dodged and took the gunfire like they were from toy guns. Eric watched it skewer an Exorcist on a signpost, lifting them like meat on a spit. He raised his own weapon, fired once, twice, until it looked at him. Really looked, and smiled. Eric ordered the airstrike. By dawn, Ashburn Hollow burned. The colony—this colony—was wiped out. Bodies smoldered beneath collapsed homes and shattered lights. But even in the smoke, something felt unfinished. President Potentia stood over the corpse of the Werehare, ribs still rising faintly with unnatural breath. “Burn it again,” he said. “Make it ash.” Evelyn Harrow stepped beside him, her gloved hand resting lightly on his arm. “This was just one colony,” she whispered. He turned to her. “You think there are more?” She nodded slowly. “I know there are.” That night, Eric dreamed. He floated in the center of a black sea, glowing under a pale light. The Moon hung above him, impossibly large. A voice, soft and old, filled his head. “The Dark Angel is approaching. Watch for the light's signs, the sun will guide you.” Eric awoke in a cold sweat, fingers clenched around the bedsheets like claws. He didn’t know what it meant. But the next phase of the nightmare had already begun.",

      "content": "I want to have deep conversations with my wife but it's a struggle. I never knew how to start a deep conversation with her, but the opportunities came. Sometime you don't have to do anyone and the thing you want will come. So when my sons blindness and deafness could be cured, we were over joyed. Our son was deaf and blind from birth and when the doctors gave his eye sight and hearing back, we had to teach him what evil and bad is. Our son had never seen or heard what evil looks like or sounds like, so we will have to show him. When our son could see and hear it was an incredible change, a miracle of science. He had always been blind and deaf and so naturally it was all new to him, to have these new senses. I had to show him what murder looked and sounded like. I first murdered a fox in front of him, but I just knew that it wasn't enough. So I found someone off the street who was down on his luck. I murdered this person right in front of my son so he knew what murder was. Later that night my wife was concerned with what I had done but it was a necessity. She started to tear up a little bit and we had the most amazing deep talk I have ever had with her. The conversation was real and not fake with fake happiness, it was based on reality. Been married for 10 years and this was our first deep conversation, and I guess when I murdered someone to show my son what murder looked like and sounded like, it brought out the deepness within my wife. My wife was grateful that I was doing all of the dirty work to show my son what evil looks like and sounds like. Then when I kidnapped someone, again it was someone no one would care about. My son knew what kidnap looked like and sounded like. My son also knew what a beating looked like and sounded like. Then when I murdered the person I had kidnapped, my son was reminded what murder looked like and sounded like. I had to do this because my son had been blind and deaf all his life, so he doesn't know what evil looks like and sounds like. Then at night time my wife was really scared with what I was doing, and we had another deep conversation that was pure real and truthful.",

      "content": "I still see him everywhere I go. That sick fucking smile. We had been searching for a missing kid for a couple of days. We all knew how these things ended up. Either he was found before dinner, or hands and feet started washing up on the bank. Hikers phoned in. They saw the kid on the north side of the river, stumbling and panicked, running from something. They said he’d been screaming for Mom. I was on nights and lumped into the search party since nothing crazy happens in this town. A couple of domestics, home invasions, and bar fights are usually what I have to attend to, so a search party didn’t seem too bad. Plus, on nights lunch was covered. I took my squad car out on the dirt roads behind the Jackson’s farm, the only man-made paths leading into the forest. I thought that, for once in this town, I could have a quiet night, free from all the broken glass and crying kids. Free from cars getting broken into. Free from the chairs being thrown at the pub. Looking back, I would've done anything to get those calls that night. I set out on foot and got pretty far out onto the riverbank, sweeping the area with my flashlight. All I found was trash. Beer cans. Crumpled cigarette packs. Nothing that screamed ‘missing kid.’ I was making my way back to my squad car when it hit me. Something was wrong. I could smell it in the air. In the way the trees were swaying. I jumped out of my skin when I heard twigs snapping and leaves rustling directly to my left. That’s when I saw him. A man, crouched over in the bushes, staring at me through his long, knotted, greasy hair. The sick fuck was smiling. He was barefoot. Thin. Wearing nothing but a dirty hospital gown. The kind they give you when you’re not supposed to go anywhere. I wish I could tell you I did something different, I really do. I froze, and couldn’t get any words out of my mouth. That damn smile still on his face. My hands snapped down to my pistol in an instant, fumbling with the clasp of the holster. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get my pistol out. The man, watching me fuck with my holster, stood there in silence. His grin spreading further and further up his face. Like he was inviting me to finally get it right. He lifted one hand, slow, deliberate, and pointed right at my holster. His voice was low, almost patient, like he had all the time in the world. “It’s not hard, brandon,” he said. “Both buttons. Together.” He knew my name. I did what he said. My hands shook so badly that I could barely feel the buttons under my fingers. I pressed them both. Heard the click. The gun finally came free. But I never pointed it at him. I didn’t even say anything. I watched as he climbed out of the bush and came up to me, inches from me. His smile never gave up. Then he leaned in for a whisper, close enough to feel his breath against my cheek. “You’ll never find him,” he said. Calm. Certain. Like it wasn’t even a question. He didn’t touch me. He didn’t even look at me again. He just turned, slow as anything, and started walking back into the trees. I didn’t call for any backup. I didn’t chase after him. I stood there frozen in fear like a little boy. I found my path back to my truck and started it. And drove away. I didn’t stop. Not until the trees were gone and the sun was bleeding up over the fields. Not until the woods, and everything inside them, were somewhere I could pretend didn’t exist. It’s been months now. I’ve moved two towns over, switched precincts, and finally bought a house with my fiancée. Sometimes, on good days, my life feels normal again. I’ll go fishing with the boys, or help my fiancée in our garden. But in those moments, I’ll see him. Submerged in the water, smiling at me, or crouching behind the rose bushes. Every time with that same fucking smile. He disappears when I blink. And I’ll never find him.",

      "content": "I used to work at Nickelodeon as a content reviewer. My job was simple: watch episodes before they aired, flag any issues, file my reports. Standard stuff. Until I found that tape. It was unlabeled except for a sticky note: \"S. B. - FINAL EPISODE - DO NOT AIR.\" The handwriting was shaky, desperate. I probably should've reported it, but curiosity got the better of me. The episode started normally enough. The familiar pineapple house, the morning bugle - but something was off. The colors were muted, almost grey, and SpongeBob's laugh had a hollow echo to it. The title card read \"The Last Shift\" in dripping red letters. No quirky music, no narrator. Just silence. SpongeBob walked to work, but his movement was wrong. Too fluid, too purposeful. The usual bounce in his step was gone. When he passed other fish, they froze, their eyes following him with what I can only describe as terror. At the Krusty Krab, mister. Krabs was counting money at his office. Normal enough. But when SpongeBob entered, mister. Krabs' claws started shaking. \"You're early, boy,\" he said, his voice trembling. \"The others aren't here yet.\" \"Oh, I know,\" SpongeBob replied. His voice was different - deeper, distorted. \"I wanted to catch you alone.\" What happened next still haunts me. SpongeBob's face contorted, his trademark smile stretching impossibly wide, revealing rows of jagged teeth. His eyes became black voids, leaking dark fluid down his face. \"Do you know how many of us you've sold, mister. Krabs?\" SpongeBob's voice was barely recognizable now. \"How many Krabby Patties? How many of my brothers and sisters, ground up for your profits?\" The animation became hyper-detailed, almost realistic. mister. Krabs backed away, but SpongeBob's arm stretched across the room, grabbing him. \"I've learned so much in this kitchen,\" SpongeBob whispered. \"About meat. About preparation. About how to make things... tender.\" The screen cut to black. When it returned, Squidward was arriving for work. The Krusty Krab's windows were dark. Inside, he found a trail of something red leading to the kitchen. The next scene... God, I wish I could unsee it. The grill was running. On it was something that looked disturbingly like a crab cake. In the corner, SpongeBob stood motionless, his usual yellow color now stained crimson. \"Welcome to the morning shift, Squidward,\" he said, turning slowly. His face was no longer cartoonish - it was detailed, realistic, horrible. \"I've been... experimenting with the secret formula.\" Squidward ran, but the doors were locked. SpongeBob's laugh echoed through the restaurant, but it wasn't his normal laugh. It was broken, wet, wrong. \"Don't you want to know what makes the Krabby Patties so special, Squidward? Don't you want to be part of the secret recipe?\" The screen went black again. This time, when it returned, it showed Bikini Bottom from above. The streets were empty. The water looked darker, thicker than normal. SpongeBob stood in the middle of the Krusty Krab, surrounded by \"patties\" that didn't look like any food I'd ever seen. The final shot was of SpongeBob looking directly at the camera, his black eyes seeming to stare into my soul. \"Are you hungry?\" he asked, his voice distorting into something inhuman. \"Everyone's welcome at the Krusty Krab. Everyone becomes part of the family here. Part of the formula. Part of me.\" The episode ended there. When I tried to rewind it, the tape disintegrated in the player. I quit my job the next day. I couldn't handle children's television after that. But sometimes, late at night, I hear that laugh. And when I order fast food, I always ask what's in their special sauce. I suggest you do the same. Because somewhere out there, that tape still exists. And SpongeBob is still cooking, still smiling, still waiting for his next customer. Are you hungry?",

      "content": "Mikey was told to never sleep on the right side of the bed and mikey obeyed this rule. Mikey never asked why he shouldn't sleep on the right side of the bed, but he followed the rule anyway. It was for mikeys own good that he was ordered to never sleep on the right side of the bed and mikey never wondered about it. He went on his way and lived his life but then one night as he went to bed on the left hand side, he started wondering about sleeping on the right hand side of the bed. Mikey couldn't fight off the temptation. Then as soon as mikey went over to the right side of the bed, he was suddenly hit with realisations that he wished he never had. He had realised that his parents had never had other children to give him siblings, he was an only child. Specifically female siblings because he has no female siblings that he can reproduce with to make healthy babies. If you make babies outside of your biological line, they will end up disabled. Mikey regretted sleeping on the right side of the bed and this realisation that he has no female siblings to reproduce with, it horrified him. He went over to the left hand side of the bed where he could heal. He was traumatised at realising he has no female siblings to reproduce with. Then on another night he dared himself to go the right side of the bed. He had this realisation that all his life he has only ever gone on dates with women that are not biologically related to him. To know which women actually loved mikey, mikey had to get a beating by fighting someone tougher than him, and he would endure an embarrassing beating. Then as he lays on the ground all beaten up, if there is any woman still along side him after getting beaten up, then that means that she truly loves him. There have only ever been 3 women in his life times that stayed with him after getting a beating, but those relationships still ended because if they had reproduced a child, then that child would surely be disabled as they are not related to each other. Mikey quickly moved back over to the left hand side of the bed. Then mikey realised that the left hand side of the bed had disappeared now, and it was only the right hand side of the bed that was left. Mikey can't go to sleep anymore.",

      "title": "Plankton's Final Formula",
      "content": "I found it in a box of old VHS tapes at my grandfather's house after he passed. He'd worked as an animator for Nickelodeon in the early 2000s, and most of the tapes were just rough cuts of regular episodes. But this one was different. The label read \"PLANKTON'S VICTORY - REJECTED CONCEPT - DESTROY IMMEDIATELY.\" I should have listened. The episode began with the Chum Bucket, but something was wrong. The usually cartoonish building looked decayed, with realistic rust stains and what looked like dried blood around its base. The sign flickered in a way that made my skin crawl. Inside, Plankton wasn't his usual comical self. The animation was different - more detailed, more wrong. His single eye was bloodshot, and his movements were twitchy, desperate. Karen's screen showed only static, with occasional flashes of what looked like security footage from the Krusty Krab. \"Day 2,557,\" Plankton's voice rasped, deeper than normal. \"They all laughed. Called me small. Insignificant. But I've finally found it. The perfect formula.\" The scene cut to his lab. The walls were covered in equations that didn't look like cartoon drawings - they looked real, scrawled in something dark and red. Among them were photographs of SpongeBob, each one crossed out with increasingly violent marks. \"Biology,\" Plankton whispered. \"That's where I went wrong. All this time chasing a recipe, when I should have been studying them. Their weaknesses. Their breaking points.\" The next scene showed SpongeBob arriving at work, but his usual happy walk was interrupted by a strange twitch. He stopped, clutching his head. The animation became disturbingly fluid as his body began to change. His holes began to weep a dark fluid. His eyes bulged. \"The microscopic world is my domain,\" Plankton's voice narrated. \"Did they really think I couldn't create something small enough to infect them all? Something that would make them... cooperative?\" mister. Krabs was the next to change. His shell began to crack, revealing pulsing flesh beneath. Squidward's tentacles twisted and split. Sandy's suit filled with something black and thick. One by one, the residents of Bikini Bottom transformed into horrible, twisted versions of themselves. The animation quality kept shifting between the normal SpongeBob style and something more realistic, more grotesque. The infected characters moved like puppets, all being drawn toward the Chum Bucket. \"They called me evil,\" Plankton laughed. \"Evil is subjective. Science is absolute. And now they're all part of my grand experiment.\" The scene returned to SpongeBob, now standing before Plankton. His usual smile was gone, replaced by a blank stare from black, empty eyes. \"The formula, sir,\" he gurgled, holding out a dripping piece of paper. \"Oh, I don't need that anymore,\" Plankton replied. \"You see, I've created something much better. A formula not for food, but for evolution. For power. For revenge.\" The camera pulled back, showing all of Bikini Bottom transformed into a twisted hellscape. The water had turned red. The buildings pulsed like living things. And at the center, the Chum Bucket had grown, its metal walls now organic, breathing. \"You wanted to protect that stupid recipe?\" Plankton's voice had become inhuman. \"Fine. Keep it. I've got the only formula that matters now. The formula for their souls.\" The final shot showed Plankton standing on a mountain of corrupted bodies, his tiny form silhouetted against a blood-red sky. His eye had multiplied, covering his body, all of them staring directly at the viewer. \"Size doesn't matter anymore,\" he whispered. \"We're all small in the end. All just specimens. All just part of the experiment.\" The tape ended there. When I tried to rewind it, the machine sparked and died. The tape melted, leaving behind a smell like rotting seafood. That night, I noticed a small green dot in my peripheral vision. When I turned to look, it was gone. But sometimes, when I'm almost asleep, I hear a tiny laugh. And my skin... it's starting to feel tight. Like something underneath wants to get out. I should never have watched that tape. But now you've read this, and you're part of the experiment too. Can you feel it yet?",

      "content": "I found the cleanest Indian market food stall in India and I couldn't believe it. Usually food market stalls in India are dirty and they aren't the most hygienic of places. Whenever I use to walk past the Indian food market stalls in India, with my dog on a dog lead which is actually my life force string, it starts to become shorter and so i call it my life lead. Something unhealthy and dirty will make your life force string shorter, while the opposite will make it longer. My life force string is becoming shorter because of how unhygienic the food stalls are in India, even just walking past them you are breathing in bacteria and germs. So my life lead on my dog becomes shorter. The more healthier you are with the addition of a great environment, your life lead will be longer and your dog can run around more. Here in India walking past unhygienic Indian food stalls, my life lead becomes shorter and my dog can't do much. If I were to even eat or drink something from street food market in India, my life lead around my dog will be so short. Then one day I went past an Indian food market stall and my life lead became longer. My dog was able to move around more and have more fun. Then I realised why the life lead around my dogs neck got longer, it's because I just happened to be in front of an indian street food market stall, which happen to be the cleanest one I had ever seen. I couldn't believe it and just breathing it in and going close to it was amazing. I had never seen such a clean food establishment within the busy Indian streets. They were following every food hygiene protocol and the food was amazing. It was surreal to find something this clean among this area. My life lead around my dogs neck was getting longer and my dog could run around more and have more fun. It was truly the cleanest Indian market stall I had ever seen. It was a fresh of breath air to have something so clean among these streets. Then as my life lead kept getting longer and longer, my dog was lost and something had taken my dog. Then I asked what food the cleanest Indian food market stall had given me, they had given me dog meat to eat. Then they had served my dog to someone else and that's why they keep it clean. To make people's life leads around their dogs become so long, that it will be harder to watch and control our dogs, and it will make it easier to abduct them.",

Dulce et decorum est pro progressu mori.** —I am taken from my home, led deep onto the plains until surrounded by their total flatness. The sun shines, relentless. A tipi is erected: inside, a fire's kindled. I am taken within, where the wisemen sit around the fire, which is wider than I am, and whose clear white smoke rises, and I am stripped and told my worth. They recite the words. They incant the prayers. I recognize most: statesmen, scientists, poets, mathematicians, judges. I know what happens now. I was bred for it. My parents were sublimates, as their parents before them, and so on and on into the long past. Our civilization is a mighty civilization, the only civilization, and I am the living promise of its future. I am the tomorrow, I say. You are the tomorrow, they repeat. I lay on the fire, on my back as the flames caress me and the burning starts to take my body apart, my skin blackens (“I am the tomorrow,” I say and say and say, louder each time, the hot pain increasing until I am but screaming ash) and melts away, my charred flesh melts away from my bones (“You are the tomorrow,” they repeat and repeat and repeat) and the smoke turns from white to darkest grey, rising and rising… The opening at the top of the tipi is shut. Nowhere to escape: the smoke fills the space, and the wisemen inhale it—inhale me—inhale my decorporated soul. Draw it up voraciously through their nostrils, befume their brains, which are cured by it, marinating in it like snails in broth as synapses fire and new connections are made, theories originated, compounds hypothesized, theorems visualized, their eyes rolling back into their heads, an overdose of ideas, their bodies falling back onto the earth, falling back, falling back— And I am no more. The tipi's gone. The plains, empty once more. The wisemen have dispersed. Even the ashes of my corpse have been swept up: to be ingested, for they contain trace amounts of soul. Only a vestige of the sublimation itself remains, a dark stain upon the landscape. Soon advancements are made. The wisemen develop new technologies, propose new ways of understanding, improve what can be improved and discard what must be discarded. The Progress is satiated. As a child, I used to stare at my own reflection in a spoon—distorted, misproportioned, inhuman—intensely terrified by the unknowability of myself, aware I was nothing but a painful container. I played. I hugged my mother and father. Then they disappeared, and the world was made better but I was alone. I married, had children. My children too are now alone in the world. In a better world. Dulce et decorum est pro progressu mori. Dulce et decorum est pro progressu mori.*",

      "content": "A couple years back in 2017 I used to work as a janitor at the Movieland wax museum in Niagara Falls, it was notorious in that area for its creepy and off-putting looking wax statues, especially the Simpsons ones. this story takes place during one of my many graveyard shifts there, it was around 1 am if i remember correctly, i remember i was cleaning off the Obama statue when i heard a thud a few rooms over, since it was so late at night nobody else was there besides me, so, fearing it was maybe one of the statues falling over, i ran to where i heard the noise from. I arrived at the room with all the creepy looking Simpsons statues but i couldn't find anything fallen over, except Bart's shorts which some teenagers must've pulled down but that wouldn't had made such a loud noise, i ended up just brushing it off as lighting and walked back to where i was to clean the Forrest Gump statue. About 10 minutes had passed when I started hearing faint talking through the walls, it could've been some customers now that I think about it since the place was still technically opened but I remember them sounding distinctly like the Simpsons characters talking. I just decided to ignore it and put my earphones back in to listen to music. I ended up getting really into the music and cleaned for like 40 minutes straight without any interruptions, that was, until I felt a sudden tap on my shoulder. I pulled my earphones out and whipped around to see who it was but nobody was there, I swear I felt something touch my shoulder though. Just when I was about to put my headphones back in I heard someone whisper \"why, I oughta-\" in my ear, It suddenly felt as though someone wrapped their hands around me and started choking me, It felt like I couldn't breath and I was slowly losing consciousness until I passed out on the floor. When I finally came to the place was in complete darkness, as my eyes adjusted I suddenly realized I was laying on the couch where people could take photos with Homer and Marge Simpson, except all the Simpsons statues were missing and it was just me in there, I looked towards the clock and saw that it was 4 AM and I had stayed way past closing. As the ringing in my ears slowly subdued I began to hear faint laughing from far away, I sat there for a few minutes in fear until I realized something, the laughing sounded exactly like the laughs of the Simpson family. As dread filled my system I shot up off the couch and quickly bumbled my way through the darkly lit place to the exit, all while hearing the laughs slowly trail behind me at a distance. when I finally made it to the doors I realized they were locked, I reached into my pocket for the keys but they weren't there, I must've dropped them when I fainted. On the brink of crying at this point I ran as fast as I could to where I was when I was when I passed out. I finally made it there but they weren't there. I just stood there, in defeat when suddenly I heard the keys jingle as something in the dark hallway in front of me threw them at me. I felt so scared I could throw up, my body going into autopilot at this point I picked up the keys and ran back to the door as fast as I could, the whole time I heard heavy sounding footsteps chasing behind me. I made it to the doors and unlocked them as fast as I could, tumbling over the turnstile and out onto the Clifton Hill street. The nighttime air hit me as I began hyperventilating, I looked around and all the lights on the strip were out, no-one was out either, which was abnormal for Clifton Hill at anytime of the day. As I crossed the street I'd finally gained the courage to look back at the wax museum. Standing just in front of the entrance, waving at me, was the wax figure of Homer Simpson, his eyes blackened and dripping with melting red wax.",

      "content": "Everyone at Big Flex Gym knew Jock. He was the king of clout. Six meals a day, six hours at the gym, and six hundred selfies a week. He flexed in the mirror like it owed him rent and treated weaker lifters like background noise. One night, fifteen minutes before closing, a strange man walked in. Wore a tattered trench coat. Long gray hair. Deep wrinkles, but his eyes… sharp. Like he saw through your skin. He walked slow. Purposeful. Jock was mid-joke with his gym bro, Boland, when the man stepped up to the front desk. “I’d like to train,” he said in a thick accent. Jock didn’t even hide the smirk. “Sorry, pops. We don’t do fantasy cosplay here.” Then he nodded toward Boland and added: “Unless you can deadlift your own casket.” Boland laughed. The man didn’t. He stepped forward, laid a dry, cold hand on Jock’s chest… and whispered: “Muscles.” Then he turned and left, boots clicking slowly against the floor. The gym cameras glitched during the moment. Footage corrupted. They brushed it off. “Probably some crazy old gypsy,” Jock joked later that night, flexing in the mirror. “He should’ve cursed me with more plates.” But the next morning? Jock woke up bigger. Chest thicker. Arms round like cannonballs. Even his traps had traps. He thought he hit some kind of genetic lottery. Told Boland, “Bro, I think the curse worked. I’m juicing without the juice.” But over the next few days, the gains kept coming. Even without working out. Even without eating. His muscles grew… and grew… and grew. At first, it was amazing. Then… it became painful. His skin tightened. Veins popped like wires under the surface. His body twitched on its own, muscles flexing involuntarily. He couldn’t sleep. Could barely breathe. He tried doctors. They couldn’t explain it. One old woman—an ex-nurse from Romania—heard his story and went pale. She only said: “He was Romani. You mocked a gypsy. A true one. They don’t curse with tricks… they curse with truth.” Jock vanished from the gym. Boland called. Texted. No answer. So one night, he went to Jock’s place. The apartment smelled like raw meat and old iron. The lights were off. Mirrors shattered. Dozens of protein tubs sat untouched—swarmed with flies. “Jock?” Boland called out. “Yo, man. You alive?” Then he heard something… heavy. Wet. Breathing. He turned the corner—and froze. There, in the center of the room, lay a massive, deformed pile of living muscle. Veins as thick as ropes. Eyes barely visible under layers of flesh. Limbs crushed under their own size. Mouth sealed by overgrown pecs. It was Jock. He was still alive. Barely. Trapped. Dying slow. Boland stumbled backward and saw a message scratched into the hardwood with what looked like broken fingernails: “He said muscles. I laughed.” Then the room got cold. Boland felt something behind him. A hand. He turned—no one was there. But right in his ear, as clear as steel slicing flesh, he heard it: “Next.”",

      "content": "To all delivery drivers becareful of people playing the kool aid man challenge. I was doing a shift at Amazon flex and I accepted a shift where I would deliver some packages in some far away area. I picked up the packages and when I drove to the area where I would be delivering those packages, I saw a guy playing the kool aid man challenge and he literally ran through a gated fence. Body bits were flying and blood was splattered everywhere, and the guy stood up and was all over the place. He looked hurt. Then another person who was also doing the kool aid man challenge, had gone through the first guy who had gone through the fence, and the second guy had completely splattered the first guys body. It was gory and disgusting and people were screaming. The second guy stood up completely unharmed and covered in blood, but he was smiling like he have was having a hell of a time. Then I saw another delivery person trying to deliver some packages to a house, then someone playing the kool aid man challenge had completely ran through the delivery person and smashed through the front door. I was really scared now of delivering in this area and Amazon didn't even bother to warm me or give me extra money. As I delivered my first package to a house, I saw two people doing the kool aid man challenge and ran through the house next door. They also ran through the family and killed them, I just stood there and stared at the carnage. Then the person who I was delivering to opened the front door and simply shouted \"give me my package!\" And I wanted to get out of the area, but I didn't have much packages so I thought that I will just keep going. I saw more kool aid man challengers running through people and houses, it was completely unacceptable. I saw one guy who had played the kool aid man challenge and he ran through a person's fence, the owner was angry and he started to give a beat down on the guy. The guy was begging to be saved and then a load of people who were taking part in the kool aid man challenge, tried to save him but they simply had gone through each other and even killing the owner and the guy asking for help. It was a complete mess and the whole area needed fixing up, insurance was going to have a messy day to fix this all up.",

      "content": "I’m Lilly, 18, and I run a TikTok debunking ghost stories, laughing off creepy noises as old pipes. Last summer, a DM tipped me off about an abandoned Maine mansion, empty since Eleanor Crane vanished in the ‘70s. Locals called it cursed—whispers, shadows, missing people. Perfect for my channel. On July 20, 2024, I drove to the pine forest’s edge with my phone, flashlight, and recorder. The mansion’s spires pierced a stormy sky, the air heavy. A broken window let me in; the air stank of mildew and rust. The foyer’s chandelier hung like broken bones, my footsteps echoing too loud. Recording, I cracked jokes, but my voice faded into the walls. The ground floor was frozen in time—dusty plates, a coat on a rack, like everyone vanished. A staircase led to a hallway of closed doors, one black and polished, no dust. My gut screamed leave, but I needed the video. The room inside was windowless, walls carved with swirls, eyes, and unreadable words. A stained chair with claw marks sat center. My recorder buzzed; the air pressed my chest. I filmed, but a whisper hissed, “Stay.” The whispers grew, a crowd muttering “never leave.” My flashlight dimmed; my phone glitched, flashing an eyeless face. I nearly dropped it. The recorder burned, static growling. Carvings shifted when I looked away. I set the recorder on the chair, pacing to stay calm. The hallway darkened, light devoured. My legs felt stuck, air choking. The whispers chanted, filling my skull. The door slammed shut; carvings glowed red. The chair creaked, empty but alive. Cold fingers grazed my arm. I screamed, sound swallowed. I clawed the door, carvings warm like skin. A voice hissed, “You’re mine.” I don’t know how the door gave, but I ran through black halls, out the window, scraping my arms. I didn’t stop until my car. My arm had spiral marks, itching at night. Eleanor Crane was found dead in that room, eyes gone, smiling. Others vanished there too. My friend grabbed my phone later; footage showed me talking to air, whispers saying my name. I deleted TikTok. I hear her voice at night. Don’t enter a Maine mansion with a black door. Some rooms trap you.",

Maybe someone changed their username. But the screen… the screen was wrong. The image was distorted—stretched vertically. A long face, glowing eyes behind thick glasses. No expression. No motion. Just a strange red blur behind them, dripping like paint—or blood—down the wall. “Who are you?” one of them typed. No response. Then, the face leaned forward. The mouth opened slowly, silently. No audio. No glitches. Just… staring. The laughter stopped. Suddenly, all the screens froze. A split-second flash of black. The call disconnected. When they returned—only three screens remained. The fourth? Gone. The missing friend was never seen online again. The next morning, there was only one file left on their desktop. No browser history. No open apps. Just a single image titled: “userlogged_in.jpg” In it, that same deformed face looked back through glowing lenses. Half out of frame. Not smiling. Just watching. And waiting.",

So I found a zoo keeper that allowed me to fight one of his gorillas all on my own. I wasn't scared but instead I could hear this song in my head but I couldn't remember the name. So as the gorilla started to beat the crap out of, yes it was painful but I wasn't scared. I started to think about the man who slapped my son. It was the postman that had slapped my son and I was angry that he had slapped my son. I confronted the postman about slapping my son for no reason at all. Then the postman said to me \"is your son good at maths now since i slapped your son?\" And yes he was good at maths now. The postman then showed me the hand that he used to slap my son. It had watered down writing of the word maths. The postman told me that what ever is written on his hands, and slaps my son with it, then my son will be good at that. My son has become seriously good at maths to the point of genius. Then as I am being beaten up by the gorilla, the gorilla isn't happy about beating me up and it isn't showing any emotion at all. Then I realised that I am wrong, that the gorilla is showing one emotion as it is beating me up. It is showing rage and anger, and they are emotions. I have got a crowd gathering who are safe from the gorilla, they probably think that I am a genius for wanting to fight a gorilla all on my own. Then I go back to thinking about that postman who slapped my son. He came up to me on another day and said to me \"is your son fixing things around your house?\" And I replied \"yes he is fixing things now?\" And the postman told me that he had slapped my son again, this time he had maintenace man written on his hands. I don't know whether to be concerned or happy that this postman is slapping my son. Then I had another thought. How did the postman know that my son needed to be slapped with something written on his hands, for my son to learn it? What the postman told me had destroyed my marriage. The postman said \"my father did the same to me. Could you now tell your son who is my biological child, to slap me in the face with the words finance banker written on his hands. This only works through biological relations like father and son, mother and daughter...\" I was crushed and I am now back concentrating on me being in the present and being beaten up by a gorilla.",

      "content": "It was late at night. The game had ended, and one by one, his friends had left the call. Only one person remained on screen: a blurry face, cloaked in shadow. The camera appeared frozen—but the smile… the smile wasn’t. It stayed. Still. Unsettling. “Hey?” the boy typed on his keyboard. No response. He assumed the video was frozen. But a few seconds later, the face tilted—just slightly. The frame hadn’t changed… yet the posture had. Same moment, same smile… but closer. And darker. A red light flickered in the corner of the screen. That’s when he noticed—his own camera wasn’t turned on. He leaned in. “Must be a glitch…” he muttered, but deep down, he knew—this wasn’t just a connection issue. He moved his hand to the mouse, ready to leave the call. Just before he clicked—the screen went black. Not Discord. The entire screen. Pitch black. Except for that smile. That deeply disturbing grin, barely visible from within the shadows. “Did my internet cut out?” he wondered. But the signal bars in the corner were still green. Everything was silent. Even the fan of his PC had stopped. Then, from his headset— A low, garbled whisper: “Connection not lost. Connection established.” He froze. Threw off his headset. But the whisper continued. And the eyes… Those eyes were no longer just part of a smile. They were empty, black hollows, staring straight at him. Not watching. Pulling. Dragging him inward. Suddenly, the green light of his webcam turned on. But he hadn’t enabled the camera. As it glowed, the boy sat frozen in front of the screen, unable to move—like something invisible was holding him there. The monitor began to glow—white, pulsing light. Then, static. Then, it froze. The last recorded image showed him, head tilted, smiling. But not an ordinary smile. Eyes vacant. As if no one was left inside. Behind him, a faint light. Around him, utter silence. The next morning, his family entered the room. The computer was still on. But the boy was gone. Not in his bed, not in his room, not anywhere in the house. Windows locked. Door locked from the inside. It was as if he’d simply… vanished. When the police arrived, all they had was one thing: A single screenshot. Frozen in the middle of a video call. And that terrifying smile. The file name read: “connection_established.jpg” No camera logs. No trace in the network history. According to the system, the internet connection had never been interrupted that night. But ever since that day, Every night at 03:17 AM, That same smile flashes on the screens of random users. And another person disappears.",

      "content": "Hello. Welcome to another episode of Mechanical Mike. As always, if you enjoy my videos, please like and subscribe. It really helps a lot, and once I hit another milestone I'll do another subscriber meet-up. Today's episode is going to be a little different than normal, but, before we get to that, I want to pass along some personal news. As you probably know, missus Mechanical Mike and I have been having marital troubles, and we've actually decided to split up. But it's OK. I'm OK. I'll still see the kids every other weekend, and this way they won't have to see us fighting. I just wanted to put that out there because I saw some speculation in the comments, and I really hate gossip, OK? I'd rather be honest with you guys. Anywho, the second piece of personal news is that I lost my job. Yeah, the factory decided to pack up and move their operations to the you. S. Sucks, but what can you do, right? So if you didn't like and subscribe already, please do so. Every click helps! With that out of the way, let's get our hands dirty. In the last few episodes we learned how vacuums work and we deconstructed a coffee machine. What we're doing today is a little different. We'll be taking apart an old fan. And instead of doing that in my usual spot, my workshop, which I don't have access to since missus Mechanical Mike kicked me out, I'll be doing it on my kitchen table. I hope you guys can see. Tell me in the comments if you can't and we'll figure it out. So, as always, the first thing we want to do is look at what the fan looks like all put together. Note what parts we see and where they are. Now, I don't have a diagram for this one, but that's half the fun, really digging around and figuring it out as we go. I'm going to start by opening the body. Sometimes there's a clean way to do that, but in this case we're going to have to brute force it a bit. Basically what I'm going to do is take this saw and start along here, really elbow-greasing it until I get a nice, long groove, and then I'm going to take a crowbar and really force it in there—like so, and then I'm going to press really freakin’ hard until it comes apart just like that. Boy, that is a real mess. But we'll clean up later. Right now we're going to see what makes this fan tick. Actually, let's play with the wires just a bit, connect them like so, and plug in to power— Oh, wow! It really does give you a new perspective to see it all exposed like that. A real anatomy. Here, let me wipe the camera and show you up close. That's the heart, the lungs… Help… me… Oh, shut up. SHUT UP! SHUT THE FUCK UP!",

      "content": "I hate driving alone at night and my head lights are broken, so it's pitch black and I'm driving on luck. Even though I'm scared I am also hating how lonely I feel. I'm just driving in the darkness and I can't see anything. Then I remember about Peter who always wanted to be a boxer but he doesn't have any arms. I told Peter that boxers need arms but Peter shouted back at me, he told me that boxers don't need arms to box. When he went into the boxing ring, he was beaten up so bad that he had brain damage. I sat there in the car driving at night with no head lights, thinking about Peter who boxed in the boxing ring with no arms. Then I bumped into something but it was so dark that I didn't see it. I just kept on driving and then I found an old man at the back of my car, he wasn't there before but it felt good not being alone. I was still driving in pitch black darkness with no head lights. Then I started thinking about the ex girlfriend that I had when I was at school. I wanted to have a skinny girlfriend, and I told her that if she couldn't fit between two tight spaces, then she wasn't skinny enough for me. She was chubby and she really squeezed herself into the tight space, she got stuck and died. I start to tear up shame and I was a terrible person. The old man sitting in the back said \"you okay son\" and I replied back by saying \"yeah I'm okay\" and then I bumped into something but I couldn't see what I had bumped into. Then there was another person at the back seat. It was a middle aged man and I was glad because this was reducing my loneliness. So it was me and the two guys at the back seat, and my driving in pitch black with my head lights broken. I was thinking about Peter and the chubby girl. When I saw both of them in the darkness, they had lit up and I was able to see what was outside. I saw the body of the old man and I must of hit him with my car, and now his soul is at the back seat of my car. Then when Peter and the chubby girl lit up even more, I saw the body of the middle aged man laying on the road. \"You are messed up your head lights aren't broken, you just enjoy driving at night time with no lightsource\" the old man told me He is right.",

      "title": "“Haunted House Scary Game” The Flash game that traumatized me as a child [Creepypasta]",
      "content": "I'm not sure whether to share this story. Some will not believe me, and others will call me crazy, but I felt it was real. It all started one morning on October 17, 2015, just a few days before Halloween. My neighborhood was getting ready for that big day of candy, spooks, and crazy costumes. I was 11 years old at the time. After lunch, I decided to go turn on my computer and look for flash games to play, there were many, but I decided to play Halloween-themed games, among many of them there was one called “Haunted House Scary Game”. I opened it and waited for it to finish loading. When it finished loading, the game menu was displayed which had a cartoonish house on a mountain. While generic children's horror music played in the background I pressed the Start button and began to play. The game started by displaying a text that read: “It's Halloween night, you go house to house trick or treating, there you find a house near the woods that is up a mountain, you decide to approach, the place looks abandoned, but clean for a person to live inside, you ring the doorbell and wait for someone to open the door and say the iconic Trick or Treat, but no one opens the door and mysteriously the door is unlocked.” After that text, I pressed the “Continue” button and it showed the inside of a Point and Click style cartoon haunted house, there were doors leading to the kitchen, the living room, a dining room, and the basement (I needed a key), the stairs led to the second floor which had a room and other locked doors, as I investigated the room I found a key that when I grabbed it a text appeared that said “Basement key obtained”. At that moment I decided to leave the room and go down the stairs to look for the basement door, I unlocked the basement and when I entered a musical box began to be heard while the basement door could be heard slamming shut. The basement looked like a dungeon with bars and torches, there was a closet that when I entered there was a picture of a family that looked like a real picture, but had something that was strange, there was on the right side a kind of nun that had a distorted face and that when the mouse approached the face it seemed that it could be pressed, when clicking on it suddenly a scream was heard along with an image of a lady with white hair and decomposing skin without eyes opening abnormally her mouth without teeth was shown as a jumpscare all this while listening in the background a song that had only one word: “Quick Solo Girl” and it seemed to repeat that part of the song over and over again and cut off some parts, as it started to repeat an image of a woman in a forest was shown, all this while an old black and white footage of an abandoned house was shown then its interior was shown which had a person covered in a white blanket sitting convulsing while vomiting a black liquid, then a shot of the window near the person vomiting the same liquid was shown, then a closer shot of the person was shown and then another closer shot, after those shots a close up of his mouth vomiting the black liquid and his eyes being seen through a mask was shown. After that footage, the same image of the woman with no eyes was shown while the distorted scream of the same woman was heard until it played a red image that said, “Game Over” and then faded to black. I thought it was the end of the whole game until it started showing a recording of a possible hospital emergency, showing a man sitting on a gurney in front of doctors surrounding the gurney. The man's face was split in half and disfigured in its entirety, It looked like the doctors were trying to help him while chicken sounds were heard in the background... chicken sounds in an echoey place? At the end of the recording, my computer shut down and I broke down crying from fear and decided to call my parents, they consoled me and then I turned on my computer to see if it did not do anything else when I finished turning on, everything seemed normal without any trace of changes and when I looked for the game again, I could not find it anywhere, no forums were talking about the game on the internet. Years later, now in 2025, I started to see a new trendy game: “Sprunki.” The visual style of the game reminded me of the same Flash game I am talking about. If you see that game, open it with caution because it will leave you traumatized and unable to sleep peacefully, like I did as a child.",

      "title": "The Old House",
      "content": "The old house stood on a hill overlooking the town, its darkened windows like vacant eyes staring into the night. Everyone in Hemlock Creek knew the stories, whispers of shadows and unexplained chills, the tale of the family that vanished without a trace a century ago. Of course, I, ever the skeptic, found it all rather quaint. Until last night. I'd taken the dare, a foolish attempt to prove the townsfolk wrong. Armed with nothing but a flashlight and a bravado I didn't truly feel, I'd pushed open the creaking front door. The air inside was thick with the smell of dust and decay, a cloying sweetness underlying it that made the hairs on my arms stand on end. Moonlight filtered through the grimy windows, painting the decaying furniture in ghostly hues. Each step echoed unnervingly in the silence. Cobwebs brushed my face like phantom fingers, and the floorboards groaned beneath my weight as if the house itself was sighing. I told myself it was just the wind, just my imagination playing tricks. Then I heard it. A faint whisper, like someone speaking just beyond the edge of hearing. It seemed to come from upstairs. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat in the oppressive stillness. Logic screamed at me to leave, to run back to the safety of the town, but a morbid curiosity, a chilling need to know, rooted me to the spot. Slowly, hesitantly, I started up the grand staircase, each step a monumental effort. The whispering grew slightly louder, a sibilant murmur I couldn't quite decipher. The air grew colder, a bone-deep chill that no draft could explain. I reached the landing. A long, dark hallway stretched before me, doors lining either side like silent sentinels. The whispering seemed to be coming from the last room on the left. My hand trembled as I reached for the doorknob. It was ice cold. With a deep breath, I pushed the door open. The room was bathed in an eerie moonlight, illuminating a single rocking chair gently swaying in the center. But there was no one in it. The whispering stopped. Relief washed over me, quickly followed by a fresh wave of unease. The chair was moving on its own. Suddenly, the temperature plummeted. I could see my breath misting in the air. A shadow flickered in the corner of my eye. I spun around, my flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. Nothing. Then, the whispering started again, closer this time, right behind me. I whipped around, but still, nothing. A cold breath brushed the back of my neck. Panic seized me. I stumbled backward, tripping over something on the floor. I scrambled to my feet, my flashlight shaking in my hand. The rocking chair was now facing me, still swaying. And in its seat, a faint, translucent figure began to coalesce. Its eyes were dark, empty sockets that seemed to pierce right through me. A silent scream built in my throat. I wanted to run, but my legs felt like lead. The figure raised a spectral hand, and the whispering intensified, becoming a chorus of mournful voices. I don't remember how I got out of that house. All I recall is the frantic pounding of my feet on the wooden stairs, the desperate gasps for air, the feeling of being chased by something unseen, something malevolent. I haven't been back to the old house on the hill. And I never will. The whispers still echo in my nightmares, a chilling reminder that some stories are more than just tales. Some shadows are real. And some houses never truly let their secrets go.",

      "content": "There is a story circulating in my hometown of Novouralsk (НовоуралЬск) in Russia about a teenager who committed experiments with various animals. A few days ago, my neighbors lost their pet dog. They were telling everybody in the neighborhood about the situation and so they told me to contact them if I were to find out some information about the dog. We talked for a bit and the father said that he remembers a kid who was around in the early 2000s, who supposedly used to abduct different animals and torture them, putting them up to some kind of experiment. He would take animals, such as cats, dogs or birds and try to converge them into one mutant. A woman who lives here claims that she saw him “playing” with his creation, some kind of cat with a beak. The father seemed to be joking about it, but it stuck with me. I tried not to give it much thought, but I also had a cat at home and was scared that something would happen to it. The man said that the teenage boy from the story disappeared from the town, never to be seen again. I wouldn’t be writing this right now if something didn’t happen yesterday. Yesterday i woke up and couldn't find my cat anywhere in the house, yard or other places around the house. I was hoping she would come back, for food at least. But I was wront. Today, I went out to my front yard and I saw the most horrible view I could imagine. My cat was back, but it was laying lifeless before me, without legs or a tail.",

      "content": "They say if you go through something traumatic as a kid, your brain kind of… protects you. Like it hides things from you until it thinks you’re old enough to deal with them. I don’t know if that’s exactly what’s happening to me, but it’s the only way I can explain it. Things have been coming back. Not all at once, and not clearly—just flashes. Feelings. Sounds. One memory triggers another and suddenly something I haven’t thought about in 20 plus years feels like it just happened yesterday. Anyway. I’ve never posted anything like this before and I probably wouldn’t now, except… I need to get it out. I need to see it written down. I need to know I’m not imagining all of this. I’m posting this from a friend’s Reddit account. I can’t use mine. Last time I even hinted at any of this online, some people came after me. Like—actual threats. Emails, weird messages, someone even sent a photo of my house. It scared the shit out of me and I deleted everything. But I can’t keep this inside anymore. So… here goes. I won’t use my name, but I will use hers: Charlotte E. You might think me wrong to do so, but when I explain what she did to me in 1998, you might feel differently. The 90s were a brutal time to be a kid. Bullying wasn’t just common—it was practically a rite of passage. Teachers often turned a blind eye, and schools rarely intervened unless someone ended up in the hospital. I remember reading about Kelly Yeomans in 1997—a 13-year-old girl from Derby, England, who took her own life after relentless bullying. Her parents had complained to the school multiple times, but nothing changed. Kids would gather outside her house, throwing food and shouting insults. Eventually, she overdosed on painkillers. Then there was Reena Virk in Canada. In 1997, she was just 14 when a group of teenagers beat her and left her to drown. She’d been bullied for years, targeted for her weight and background. Her death became a national tragedy. I bring this up because I want you to understand the environment we were in. Bullying wasn’t just overlooked—it was ingrained in the culture. And Charlotte? She thrived in it. One day in 1998, I saw a piece of paper being passed around the classroom. It started at the back row and made its way forward, kids giggling, heads bent low like they were sharing some inside joke. A girl I was friendly with—her name was Rose—caught my eye. She looked sheepish, guilty. She mouthed something like sorry as it reached my desk. I didn’t wait. I snatched the paper out of her hands before she could say anything else. It was a poll. In block letters at the top it said: “Should [my name] kill herself?” Underneath, two columns. Yes. No. I counted. Fourteen tallies under “Yes.” None under “No.” End of part 1. I need to take a break here. I promise when I continue the supernaturally horrific parts of my story will come to life. I posted this to no sleep but was removed for what reason I don’t know… they told me to post it to a more appropriate community so I’m putting it here.",

      "title": "“Haunted House Scary Game” The Flash game that traumatized me as a child [Creepypasta].",
      "content": "I don't know whether to tell this anecdote. Some will not believe me, and others will call me crazy, but I felt it was real. It all started one morning on October 17, 2015, just a few days before Halloween. My neighborhood was preparing for that big day of candy, spooks, and crazy costumes. I was 11 years old at the time. After lunch, I decided to turn on my computer and look for flash games to play. There were many, but I decided to play Halloween-themed games. Among many of them, there was one called “Haunted House Scary Game.” I opened it and waited for it to finish loading. When it finished loading, the game menu was displayed which had a cartoonish house on a mountain. While generic children's horror music played in the background I pressed the Start button and began to play. The game started by displaying a text that read: “It's Halloween night, you go house to house trick or treating, there you find a house near the woods that is up a mountain, you decide to approach, the place looks abandoned, but clean for a person to live inside, you ring the doorbell and wait for someone to open the door and say the iconic Trick or Treat, but no one opens the door and mysteriously the door is unlocked.” After that text, I pressed the “Continue” button and it showed the inside of a Point and Click style cartoon haunted house, there were doors leading to the kitchen, the living room, a dining room, and the basement (I needed a key), the stairs led to the second floor which had a room and other locked doors, as I investigated the room I found a key that when I grabbed it a text appeared that said “Basement key obtained”. At that moment I decided to leave the room and go down the stairs to look for the basement door, I unlocked the basement and when I entered a musical box began to be heard while the basement door could be heard slamming shut, the basement looked like a dungeon with bars and torches, there was a closet that when I entered there was a picture of a family that looked like a real picture, but had something that was strange, there was on the right side a kind of nun that had a distorted face and that when the mouse approached the face it seemed that it could be pressed, when clicking on it suddenly a scream was heard along with an image of a lady with white hair and decomposing skin without eyes opening abnormally her mouth without teeth was shown as a jumpscare all this while listening in the background a song that had only one word: “Quick Solo Girl” and it seemed to repeat that part of the song over and over again and cut off some parts, as it started to repeat an image of a woman in a forest was shown, all this while an old black and white footage of an abandoned house was shown then its interior was shown which had a person covered in a white blanket sitting convulsing while vomiting a black liquid, then a shot of the window near the person vomiting the same liquid was shown, then a closer shot of the person was shown and then another closer shot, after those shots a close up of his mouth vomiting the black liquid and his eyes being seen through a mask was shown. After that footage, the same image of the woman with no eyes was shown while the distorted scream of the same woman was heard until it played a red image that said, “Game Over” and then faded to black. I thought it was the end of the whole game until it started showing a recording of a possible hospital emergency showing a man sitting on a gurney in front of doctors surrounding the gurney. The man's face was split in half and disfigured in its entirety, it looked like the doctors were trying to help him while chicken sounds were heard in the background... chicken sounds in an echoey place? At the end of the recording, my computer shut down and I broke down crying from fear and decided to call my parents, they consoled me and then I turned on my computer to see if it did not do anything else when I finished turning on, everything seemed normal without any trace of changes and when I looked for the game again, I could not find it anywhere, there were no forums talking about the game on the internet. Years later, now in 2025, I started to see a new trendy game: “Sprunki” The visual style of the game, reminded me of the same Flash game I am talking about. If you see that game, open it with caution because it will leave you traumatized and unable to sleep peacefully like I did as a child.",

      "content": "Coach Mackey was a legend. Everyone in the bodybuilding world knew his name — a kingmaker who could turn any rookie into a god. So when he personally invited me and a few others to his new “elite camp,” we didn’t even ask questions. We packed our bags, signed the waivers, and showed up. The camp was deep in the woods. No cell service. No outside contact. Just lifting, eating, and grinding — as Mackey said — “until there’s nothing left but the strongest version of you.” At first it was brutal, but manageable. Then guys started disappearing. First Marcus. Went for a “late-night cardio session” and never came back. Coach said he washed out. Weak. Then Jake. Last I saw, he was gasping after a brutal squat set. Coach sent him to “rehab.” We never saw him again. At night, I started hearing noises. Dragging. Screams cut off too fast. A low, constant humming in the distance, like some huge machine chewing through bone. Ryan tried to leave. Packed a bag and sprinted down the dirt road. Coach caught him before he hit the trees. I watched from my window as Coach carried Ryan’s body — limp, bloody, twitching — straight into the old barn. The next morning, Ryan’s bunk was stripped clean. No goodbye. No explanation. Just silence. That’s when I understood. Coach wasn’t training us. He was selecting us. Grading the meat. Choosing which ones were ripe for processing. I tried to hide. Skipped meals. Pretended to be injured. But tonight, Coach knocked on my cabin door. “Your turn,” he said. Behind him, the barn doors were swinging open. Inside, massive industrial meat grinders stood waiting, their blades still slick and red. Hooks dangled from the ceiling, swaying slightly, each one dripping a slow, steady line of blood onto the concrete floor. And hanging above the grinders were the bodies — or what was left of them. Muscle torn from bone. Tanned, veiny arms reduced to ribbons. Huge chests and legs packed like sides of beef, waiting to be fed into the machines. I saw Marcus’s face for a second. Still beautiful. Still strong. Frozen in silent agony as his shredded torso slipped down into the grinder’s open mouth. The machine roared to life. Bone snapped like twigs. Flesh twisted and folded as the grinders swallowed him whole, spraying red mist across the walls. A thick, pink sludge oozed out the other side, pouring into black vacuum-sealed bags stacked neatly on pallets marked EXPORT QUALITY. Coach smiled wide. “Big boys make the best meat,” he said. “Real tender. Real juicy.” I tried to scream, but the chains around my ankles tightened. Coach reached for a hooked pole, the tip already slick with blood. At IronTemple, you don’t win by being strong. You get ground up for the highest bidder. And someone, somewhere, was already waiting to sink their teeth into me. ⸻ END.",

      "content": "I used to think nothing could be worse than losing my dad. Then I found his old N64 in the attic. It was boxed up with his other stuff – you know, the things mom couldn't bear to look at after the accident. The console was dusty, but the golden Ocarina of Time cartridge still gleamed like it was fresh from the store. Dad and I used to play it together every Sunday. He'd help me through the Water Temple, and I'd pretend to be scared of ReDeads just so he'd cover my eyes. I hooked it up to my TV that night, more out of nostalgia than anything else. The startup screen flickered to life, that familiar melody filling my room. But something was off. Instead of the usual three save files, there was only one. \"PHANTOM\" it read, with 72 hours played. That wasn't right. Dad always named his file \"DAD,\" and I was \"KIDDO.\" We never had a file named \"PHANTOM.\" I selected it anyway. The game loaded straight into the Shadow Temple, but everything was... wrong. The textures were distorted, stretched like faces in a funhouse mirror. The background music played in reverse, a discordant mess of notes that made my skin crawl. Link stood motionless in the center of the room, facing away from the camera. I tried moving him, but he wouldn't respond. After a few seconds, he slowly turned around on his own. His face was my dad's. Not some crude pixel art or a glitchy texture – it was an actual photograph of my father's face, mapped perfectly onto Link's model. The same warm smile he had in the last photo taken before the crash. The screen went black. When it came back, Link – or whatever it was – stood in Ganon's Castle. But instead of Phantom Ganon floating there, it was a twisted, polygonal version of the semi-truck that had killed my father. The model glitched and contorted, its headlights burning like evil eyes. A text box appeared: \"Some phantoms don't stay in their paintings, kiddo.\" I hit the power button, but the game kept running. Link/Dad turned to face the screen again, reaching out as if trying to touch me through the glass. The truck-phantom swooped closer, its textures corrupting more with each pass. Another text box: \"I'm still trying to save you.\" That's when I noticed the date on the save file: 72 hours played. The exact amount of time between dad's accident and when they turned off his life support. I don't know how long I sat there crying before I finally unplugged the console. The next morning, the N64 was gone from where I'd left it. The box in the attic was empty too, except for a single piece of paper – a crayon drawing I'd made of Dad and me playing Zelda together. Sometimes late at night, I hear the reversed Shadow Temple music drifting up from downstairs. I never go to check, but I know what I'd find: Dad, still trying to beat that last phantom, still trying to protect me. Some games don't end when you turn them off. Some saves can't be overwritten. And some phantoms... some phantoms just want one more Sunday with their kid.",

      "content": "28 December,2024 2:30 am I'm staying up, lights of my rooms on, as always, because yeah, I have to do the assignment. Suddenly my neck is aching. Ugh... Guess I need to take a break. So, I walk to the living room, sit on the couch, turn the TV on and start to browse channels, especially the cartoon ones because those Hindi dramas...aren't my cup of coffee. Suddenly I stumble into animax. What? I thought that channel was closed long ago. I guess they bought it back... So, I shake it off and start to watch it. Okay, just an random anime going on... I keep watching it. Then suddenly, with a glitch... I see that the next show is My Hero Academia OVA. Wait...why does the design looks like a fanmade... The OVA name...\"My Hero Academia: A Burned Dream\"? What kind of name is this?! Then suddenly the music is not really like the usual openings. It keeps changing the tempo in an ominous way. It doesn't sound normal at all... After that off-tuned opening, I see Midoriya studying in the night, exactly like how I'm studying and— wait...why does this look like my room? It's not exactly the same,but the setup looks like mine. Then suddenly, he hears the rustle. I feel like the rustle is coming from my room. The screen is glitching as he's coming closer to the wardrobe. He sees a hoodie that he doesn't remember belonging. Then suddenly, he hears the whispers. Midoriya. I also can feel the whisper through my ears. I turn back and see nothing. Then I turn my head to the TV. He's back to study again. Then suddenly, the scene shifts into the school. Aizawa sees him. Aizawa's inner monologue is like \"why does he look familiar?\" Then he remembers the incident when Endeavor was the teacher instead of Aizawa. Aizawa was new back then. Endeavor happened to burn the training arena and apparently half of the students were taken away. Iida, Tsuyu, Sero, Shoji, Aoyama, Tokoyami, Satou, Hagakure and... Midoriya. He's shocked. Wait, how is Midoriya alive? The scene cuts and shows him just wandering. Suddenly he stops by the old storage, which is so forgotten by everyone. Then his eyes go on a mirror. In the mirror, however, he saw nothing but a version of himself...his skin burned. His eyes are still determined, but it's saddened. It says, \"I couldn't save anyone, Izuku. I couldn't, I couldn't fulfill my dream.\" Midoriya gets scared. \"who are you? What are you doing here?\" \"I am you, from the other universe. Back then, when Endeavor was the teacher, he accidentally burned the training arena and half of us died. I-I could not save anyone.\" It starts crying. I swear I clench my heart. Tears fall from my eyes. I want to hug Midoriya. \"You are living my dream.\" And then the scene ends. Full black. I don't know what actually happened to Midoriya. Then after a few seconds , the credit rolls. No music. Just texts scrolling up. Then I notice something weird...all the writings are in japanese...one is only in English...it says \"©bones at 2010\" Wait...not even MHA manga started back then! Suddenly the room's lights are flickering. I just rush into my sister's room to wake her up \"Sis, did you see something? Did you feel something\" \"No,I didn't feel anything. Don't scare me like that. You know that I'm scared of this kind of stuff\" as she rubs her eyes. \"I'm sorry\" 28 January 2025 4:00 PM It's been a month and I still can't figure out what happened that day. I tell one of my junior who likes anime, about the channel as I can't find it anymore. \"It never came back.\"",

      "content": "Why aren't you scared of me grillian? \"Because I'm so grateful for everything that I have and all those still left with me. I do not concentrate on those that I have lost, I concentrate on those that are still with me\" and as I heard grillian say this, I couldn't help but feel that there was something off with it. You see I can't sit down on chairs or a log of wood, and when I try to sit down on a chair and anything in between, my legs won't bend and a force would stop me or push me out of the way. I can only sit down on people. I also can't lay down on a bed as my body won't allow it, and something pushes me straight back up to be standing. People don't realise what a privilege it is to be able to sit down and relax. As my legs get weary I cannot sit down or even lay down on a bed, so I find someone and I sit down on them with all my weight on top of them. My weight becomes so heavy that it kills them, and then I get up and I feel bad about it, but I need to sit down and lay down somewhere eventually. Then when I forced myself into grillians house after they left the door open, because it was a hot day, I had been standing for 3 days straight. So when I sat down on grillians youngest son they all tried shooting at me and stabbing me, they also tried putting a beating on me. When I am sitting on someone I am literally invincible where nothing can kill me. I am only vulnerable when standing. Then grillian said \"I am grateful that I still have 2 children and my wife that are still alive. I am not afraid of you\" Then when I sat down on his second oldest child grillian said \"I am grateful that I still have 1 of my children and my wife that are still alive. I am not afraid of you\" Then I sat down on his eldest child and he said \"I am grateful that I still have my wife that is still alive. I am not afraid of you\" So I questioned why he isn't afraid of me and as I sat down on his wife, he did something unacceptable as he tried to sit down on me as I was sitting on his wife. I screamed out loud \"do you think I was born yesterday! I was actually born 2 days ago and the first day was one hell of a day\" Then i sat down on grillian and I felt more rested.",

      "content": "If you’re reading this, then either you’re thinking about moving to Oar’s Rest, or you’ve already made the mistake and landed here. Either way: listen closely. I’m not writing this for fun. I’m not writing this to scare you off, either. I’m writing it because if you don’t know the rules, you’re going to die. Oar’s Rest is a small harbor town wedged against the Pacific, on the kind of jagged coastline where the cliffs are always crumbling, the waves are always angry, and the mist never really goes away. There’s a reason we don’t have many tourists. There’s a reason none of the locals ever swim past the third buoy. There’s a reason we still survive at all. Her name is the Guardian. At least, that’s what most of us call her. Some of the older fishermen call her “The Black Siren.” Some of the women from the Outer Cliffs call her “Mother Beneath.” I even heard one drunk asshole call her “God’s Last Dog” once. But it doesn’t matter what you call her. She’s the same thing. And if you fuck with her, she will fuck with you back. Nobody survives the Guardian’s anger. Nobody. That being said, she’s not exactly evil. Without her, we’d all be dead a dozen times over. She guards this harbor from things that make her look tame. You’ll see. If you stay long enough, you’ll see. That being said, here are the rules you need to follow if you want to survive your stay here: ⸻ Rule 1: Never, ever call out across the water after dark. The ocean is not empty at night. If you shout your friend’s name, the thing that calls back might sound just like them—but it won’t be. If you hear your name whispered from the water after midnight, ignore it. Don’t answer. Don’t even look. The Guardian will usually keep those things away from the docks, but if you invite them closer, you’re on your own. ⸻ Rule 2: Stay behind the third buoy. You’ll see them floating out there, big ugly orange things bobbing in a lazy line. They’re the boundary. They aren’t there for your safety from boats or currents. They’re there to mark the end of the Guardian’s territory. Past that line, you’re prey. Not even she can save you if you’re dumb enough to go beyond. ⸻ Rule 3: Never harm a sea creature inside the harbor. Fish, crabs, even the ugly barnacle things that cling to the pilings—don’t mess with them. If you catch something, treat it with respect. If you see a stranded jellyfish, put it back. One time, a teenager speared an octopus for fun in the shallows. Everyone found his kayak floating upside down the next morning, gutted like a fish. No body. No blood trail. Just the kayak… and the claw marks inside it. We all knew who did it. No one blamed her. ⸻ Rule 4: If you see the Guardian, mind your business. She’s not pretty in the way you’d think. Tall, slender—almost stretched too thin to be real. Smooth black and grey skin that doesn’t catch the light. Quills down her spine like a hellish porcupine. No eyes. No nose. Just that mouth—a wide, splitting thing with a double lower jaw that looks like it could shear your arm clean off. Sometimes you’ll see the glowing tips of her antennae hovering above the water, like two fireflies floating in the mist. If you see her: look down. Mind your business. Pretend you never saw anything at all. The Guardian doesn’t like being stared at. ⸻ Rule 5: Pay attention to the mist. Most mornings, Oar’s Rest wakes up blanketed in thick, cold fog. That’s normal. But if the mist turns blue—even a little—get indoors and lock your doors. That means she’s fighting something out there. Something bad enough that even she can’t keep it entirely hidden. If you stay outside, you’re fair game. She’ll kill whatever she’s fighting—and she’ll kill you too, if you’re in the way. Collateral damage. ⸻ Rule 6: If you hurt her, she will not forgive. I don’t care if it was an accident. I don’t care if you “didn’t know.” I don’t even care if you survive the first night after. You lay a hand on her, or even try to— You are a dead man walking. It might take hours. It might take days. But when you least expect it, you’ll hear a scraping at your door… …and you won’t see morning. ⸻ I guess you might be wondering: why do we even stay? Why not just leave? The thing is… we have left, before. Once. Back in ’78. They called it “The Empty Summer.” The Guardian disappeared for three straight months. No sightings. No blue mist. Nothing. We thought maybe we were free. Maybe we could open up the harbor, start bringing in tourists, build a real town. In those three months, thirty-seven people disappeared. They didn’t just vanish, either. We found bones. We found hands. We found things that looked like shark bites, but the teeth marks were too wide, too deep. We found a boat washed up on the rocks with something still alive tangled in the nets—a thing that screamed like a child and bit through solid iron. The Guardian came back after the third full moon. And everything else… went quiet. We don’t take her for granted anymore.",

      "content": "Some scars time won't let you erase. Some debts time won't let you forget. Kevin, Stephen, and I had been inseparable since middle school. Neighbors first, then classmates, and eventually brothers in everything but blood. Stephen was the dreamer among us. Obsessed with time travel — talking about it, studying it, believing someday he could bend the flow of time. Kevin and I used to laugh it off, thinking it was just another one of his weird phases. Until one night, Stephen called us over. He had built it. A real time machine. We didn't believe him, not until we watched a banana disappear into thin air after he punched in a random date — March 11, 1964. It was insane. Terrifying. The machine worked. Stephen warned us it was unstable, not ready for human use. Kevin nodded along, smiling like always. I thought he was just amazed like I was. That night, Kevin called me at 1 AM. His voice was hollow, broken. He said he was going to use the machine to kill his younger self — an easy way out without leaving a mess behind. I thought he was just drunk or tired. I told him to sleep it off. I hung up. The next morning, Stephen called me in a panic. The machine had been used again. We both knew immediately. Kevin. We chased him across decades. Found him lurking outside his old house, staring at the boy he used to be. He held a knife. It took everything I had to pull him back. Stephen begged. I begged. We told him: time isn’t a river you can dam up. It's a flood — and if you mess with it, it drowns you. Somehow, we convinced him. He dropped the knife. He cried like I'd never seen before. But getting home wasn't easy. The machine was barely working. We had to rebuild it from scraps, spent days scavenging and praying we'd get the math right. When we finally returned to our own time... something was wrong. Stephen and I stepped out of the machine and looked at Kevin. We didn’t recognize him. Not even a flicker of memory. \"Guys, come on,\" he laughed nervously. \"It's me. Kevin.\" We stared at him like he was a stranger. Because he was. Kevin broke down. Cursed us. Begged us to remember. We couldn't. He left, a broken thing. That night, I heard screaming from the house next door. Kevin. I didn't get up. By morning, they found him — throat slit, body sprawled across the front yard. They called it a tragedy. A suicide. But I remember standing by the window that morning, feeling a strange emptiness gnawing at me. Something was missing. Someone was missing. And somehow... I knew it was my fault.",

      "content": "It was an ordinary night. The wind was calm, and the noise of the city seemed to disappear. I was home, alone, as usual on Saturday nights. The television was on, but I wasn't paying attention to anything in particular; I was just passing the time, like anyone else would. There was something strange about that night, something I couldn't quite put my finger on. It wasn't a specific sound, but a feeling. A feeling that something wasn't right. Something was just... off. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't. I got up from the couch and walked over to the window. The sky was clear, cloudless, and the street was deserted. Nothing major, but still, there was something nagging at my mind. Something I couldn't shake. I went back to the couch and turned on the radio, trying to relax. Soft music started playing, but as the sound spread throughout the room, I noticed something that made me freeze. The music wasn't just coming from the radio... It seemed to be coming from somewhere behind me. I quickly looked back, but there was nothing. The room was empty, except for the soft light of the lamp above me. The feeling of discomfort intensified. Something was there, and I couldn't see what it was. \"It's just my mind playing tricks,\" I thought. \"It's okay.\" That's when I heard the first whisper. It was low, almost inaudible, but something was clearly saying my name. \"Elios...\" the voice called, softly, as if it were in a dark corner of the room, right behind me. My heart started beating faster. I turned around slowly, trying to locate the source of the voice, but there was no one. The room was empty, except for me and the feeling that something was approaching. I grabbed my cell phone and started looking for distractions. Discord, social media, anything to take me away from those strange feelings. When I looked at the clock on the wall, I realized that time seemed to have stopped. It was already 11:30 p.m., but it felt like I had entered a strange state of suspension. My hands were cold. Suddenly, a light flickered in a corner of the room, near the window. I quickly went over to it, but when I looked outside, I saw something even stranger. In the reflection of the window, I saw a shadow, a dark figure that shouldn't have been there. It was standing still, staring straight at me. My breathing became heavy, and on impulse, I ran to the door of the room to close it. But when I touched the handle, I felt something cold, like an invisible hand, grabbing my wrist. \"No... I can't leave.\" The voice was clearer now. It was a low whisper, but now, it seemed to come from everywhere at once. \"You're never going to leave again.\" I took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. \"This can't be happening,\" I thought. But when I looked to the side, I saw eyes glowing in the darkness. They weren't human eyes. They were large, black, and they moved around the room, as if they were watching my every move. The creature was getting closer, and I couldn’t run anymore. There was nowhere to run. It was there, but I couldn’t really see it. I could only feel its presence. The air was heavy, as if I were breathing water. The room seemed to shrink around me, and the feeling of suffocation grew stronger. My mind was in a state of total panic, and the lights began to flicker violently. The sound of the radio, which had been soft before, now turned into loud static, as if it was about to explode in some kind of distortion. It was then that I heard it again. The voice. But it was no longer a whisper. It was clear, strong, and the phrase it was saying was now burning into my mind. “You will never leave here. You are with me now.” Fear took hold of me in such an intense way that I could barely move anymore. I was trapped in the room, but not physically. I was trapped in the mind of what was watching me. The room began to spin and distort. The walls twisted, and shadows seemed to dance in the dim light of the lamp. I no longer knew what was real. And then, the door I thought had closed opened of its own accord. The room was cold, icy, and I knew something was waiting on the other side. Something that shouldn't be there. I could no longer see the light. Everything around me became pitch black. I didn't know what was happening, but I was no longer alone. Something had taken me, and now I was lost, with no chance of escape. The radio went silent. And all that was left was silence.",

Sometimes I just do it out of curiosity and when I have nothing else to do. When I looked at the mirror and saw my reflection, I could read my reflections minds. More like hearing its thoughts and desires. It was truly captivating and worrying at the same time. I kept hearing my reflections minds going on about keeping warm inside the oven, but it wasn't scared of being burned alive. The reason why my reflection wasn't worried about being cooked inside the oven, was because it will take another person with it inside the oven. So while my reflection would enjoy being inside the oven, the other person will be taking the punishment of being cooked. My reflections mind kept going on about wanting to be inside the oven and it was obsessed with the oven. I then had to cover up the mirror. Reading anyone's mind can be quite harrowing. I guess there are some things that no one should know. Then when I wanted to look in the mirror again to hear the thoughts of my reflections mind, it started to say how it wanted to operate on animals and make them look as close to human as possible. My reflections kept on about how it could make a cat look as human as possible and even dogs. People will simply think that there are people acting like animals, when in fact they are actually animals that had been heavily operated on to look as human as much as possible. My reflections mind kept pondering animal to operate on, to make it look human. I couldn't look at the mirror anymore as I couldn't take anymore from my reflections minds. I don't know why my reflection has such a weird mind and why these kinds of thoughts go through its mind. Then I couldn't help but look at the mirror again, as soon as I saw my reflection I could hear its thoughts again. It was just screams and pure hatred filth. The mind didn't make sense but then it started to think about operating on animals, to make them look human. I couldn't hear anymore from my reflections mind, then I saw a small man in my living room who was moving like a cat...",

      "title": "Naruto's Lost Shadow Clone",
      "content": "\"They say not every shadow clone disappears when it's supposed to..\" It was during a brutal battle deep in the forests near the Hidden Mist Village, when Naruto, exhausted but desperate, unleashed a mass of shadow clones. In the chaos, with jutsu and steel flashing around him, he never noticed — one of them… didn't vanish. This clone, unlike the others, hesitated after taking a lethal blow. But instead of evaporating into a puff of smoke like the rest, something twisted inside it — a spark of independent thought. Consciousness. It blinked, confused, feeling the overwhelming heat of its own pulse, the hunger gnawing at its gut. It looked around the battlefield and realized something terrifying: it did not want to die. Silently, it slipped away, unnoticed even by Naruto himself, merging into the shadows of the dense forest. At first, the clone tried to survive by simply hiding. But there was a problem — its body, being a construct of chakra and severed from the source, was unstable. Without constant replenishment, it began to wither, pieces of its existence fading like mist. The pain was unbearable. And that's when it discovered something disturbing: if it consumed the flesh of other shinobi, it could absorb their chakra. The first kill was clumsy. A wandering Mist-nin, lost and wounded. The clone, still bearing Naruto’s innocent face and bright blue eyes, approached the man with a trembling smile, pretending to offer help. When the man leaned on him, the clone dragged him into a hollowed tree trunk and tore into him like a wild beast. The taste was addicting. The feeling of chakra pouring into its false body, knitting the instability back together, was better than anything it could have imagined. From then on, it became a predator, wearing Naruto's face like a mask. It would approach unsuspecting victims — sometimes with laughter, sometimes with concern — and lead them away, whispering: \"This way... it's safe here, —dattebayo...\" Only for the screams to be swallowed by the trees. Weeks passed. The clone grew stronger. Its features started warping slightly — teeth sharper, hair a shade darker, eyes flickering a red-orange hue when it lost control. It learned to hide these imperfections behind a cheerful smile, an almost flawless imitation of the real Naruto. But deep inside, it no longer felt like a shadow or an extension. It believed it was Naruto. A better Naruto — one unbound by morals, by weakness, by ties to others. There was only one thing left to do: eliminate the original. One misty evening, Naruto found himself alone while scouting for rogue shinobi. The air was cold, too cold for the season, and a strange stillness hung over the woods. Then he heard it: the familiar chuckle. \"Yo! How are you my brother! Long time no see..,\" said a voice identical to his own. Naruto spun around, kunai drawn — and there it was: himself, standing a few feet away, grinning wildly. But something was wrong. The grin was too wide. The eyes too hungry. The chakra... twisted. \"Who the hell are you?\" Naruto barked, sensing the malevolence oozing off the figure. The clone only laughed, a hoarse, grating sound. \"C'mon, don't be like that. I'm you... your missing alter ego..\" Before Naruto could react, the clone lunged. Their clash lit up the forest in flashes of violent energy. But the clone fought dirty — biting, clawing, using forbidden jutsu Naruto had never even learned. In between strikes, the clone hissed: \"I'll take your place... Nobody will even know you're gone. I'll be the hero. I'll be loved. And I'll never... EVER... be weak again!\" The fight raged on for what felt like hours. Blood stained the earth. Trees shattered. Birds fled screaming. Finally, Naruto managed to pierce the clone's chest with a Rasengan, its body shuddering, cracking like broken glass. But before it dissolved, it whispered one last time: \"There are others... you made so many of us... you think I'm the only one who woke up?\" With that, it shattered into mist, leaving Naruto alone, heart hammering in the silence. Since that night, Naruto never used the Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu again without a sense of unease gnawing at him. Maybe that's why the First Hokage declared it a forbidden jutsu. Sometimes, in the dead of night, he swore he saw his own face grinning at him from the treeline. Other times, villagers would vanish — last seen smiling and walking with someone they trusted deeply. Someone... who looked just like Naruto. They say shadows can never be trusted. And some of them... never truly leave.",

And yet, we sit. Staring. Breathing. Thinking. If I really concentrated on moving, I could feel her touch again. Talking? Pointless. Try forming words when it takes months to move your lips. Who could keep a thought alive for so long? We communicate in flickers—eyes shifting a fraction, a twitch of a finger. But you can only say so much with a stare. Those outside—alone? They’ve gone mad. Lost in empty streets, drifting through a world that won’t move. The ones trapped in darkness, in the dead of night? God help them. And what of those who slept when it began? Maybe they were the lucky ones. Or maybe they’re still dreaming, wandering nightmares that stretch on forever. My son... he was late to the table. He’s upstairs, in his room. Trapped. Alone.

It's the best to for apologies to happen and I don't like it when apologies either come to early or late. My country is at war and dead bodies are everywhere, everything is being rationed and destruction is rife. The will to survive is strong though and we all kept going. I am disciplined though and I mean it when I say that at 10:45 pm, is when I will accept apologies. So when takar came to me and apologised to me at 10:46 pm I was furious. I had murderous thoughts and then I noticed that I am living in a war zone. Buildings have been bombed and collapsed, and so when I murdered takar for apologising to me at 10:46 pm instead of 10:45pm, I realised that a war zone is a perfect place for a murderer and serial killer. No one will even tell the difference whether someone had been killed through war, or from a murderer or serial killer. It's crazy how I am in the right environment. Then when eranica apologised to me at 10:44pm instead of 10:45 pm I was disgusted by her. There had been more bombs thrown down us before and that meant more fresh dead bodies. So when I murdered eranica for apologising to me at 10:44pm instead of 10:45 pm, I just put her body into the rubble and no one will be able to tell that she was murdered, they will simply think that she is a victim of war. Then I started to succumb to survivors guilt because I am so lucky to be born in a place, where there are so many people being killed and bodies all over the place. Imagine someone murdering someone in a place where it is peaceful and not a war zone, if i murdered someone in a non war zone place I would be struggling to not get caught. Luckily I live in a war zone place and dead bodies are a common sight. I have been so ungrateful to my situation where it makes it easier to murder. So I decided to go to the mirror and say sorry to myself for being ungrateful. Then I realised that I said sorry to myself at 10:44 pm instead of 10:45pm. My reflection turned angry and came out of the mirror to try and kill me. I ran away and I am still running away.",

      "content": "My name is Artur Amatis. At least, that’s the name I was given when Marilyn and Simon adopted me. I was five years old, too young to remember my real parents, and too desperate for love to question much about them. For four years, life was… normal. Or so I thought. They gave me a warm bed, hot meals, toys. everything a boy could want. Marilyn always kissed me on the forehead before bedtime. Simon taught me how to fix old clocks and catch frogs by the pond. I called them Mom and Dad, and I meant it. When I turned nine, they threw a birthday party for me. Balloons, chocolate cake, colorful hats. it was perfect. After the guests left, Simon leaned down to me with a strange look in his eye, one I hadn’t seen before. “Come with me, Artur,” he said. “I have a special surprise for you in the basement.” I followed without hesitation. Wondering if they got me the electric car i wished for. The basement door groaned open, releasing a musty, metallic smell. We descended the creaking wooden stairs, the light growing dimmer with every step until Simon pulled a dangling chain, illuminating the room with a sickly yellow bulb, which was already on it’s way of dying out. It flickered and sounded creepy to me. I looked arpund carefully and what I saw will never leave me. Tanks lined the walls, each one filled with grotesque creatures. A cat with the wings of a bat, a rabbit with the scales of a fish, a dog that blinked with human eyes. Some of them twitched, others floated lifelessly. In the corner, jars were stacked.. full of swirling, unnatural substances. Simon smiled proudly. “These,” he said, waving an arm, “are my life’s work. My experiments.” I tried to step back, but his hand clamped down on my shoulder. “You’re special, Artur. Very special. And now… you’re ready.” Before I could scream, he threw me onto a cold metal table. Straps snapped shut around my wrists and ankles. I begged him to stop, I cried for Marilyn, but she never came. Simon rummaged through the jars and selected one filled with a pulsing green liquid. I remember the label: UNKNOWN cMPs HUMAN #4£¥€£#. “This one,” he whispered, almost lovingly, “this one could change everything.” The needle gleamed under the basement light as he filled the syringe. I thrashed and struggled, but it was no use. The needle pierced my arm, and the burning started immediately. It felt like my veins were filled with fire and ice at the same time. I cried out, the stinging pain entering my system, my skin felt like it would melt away. Simon watched, fascinated, as my body convulsed. Then… he left. He left me down there, strapped to that table, with only the humming tanks and the broken, twisted animals for company. The first day, I screamed until my voice gave out. The second day, I wept until my eyes were swollen shut. The third day, something changed. My skin began to tingle. I opened my eyes, waiting for them to adjust to the sickening darkness and saw a faint green glow pulsing beneath my skin, like the heartbeat of some alien creature. The pain in my muscles was replaced by an awful, coiling strength. I yanked at the straps. They tore like wet paper. I stood up, my body aching, my muscles tense. I barely recognized my own reflection in a cracked mirror on the wall. My eyes glowed faintly, and my hands trembled with barely contained power. I didn’t think. I just ran. I smashed through the basement door and stumbled up the stairs. Simon was there, waiting at the top, holding another syringe. His eyes widened when he saw me. “Wait!” he shouted. “Artur, stop!” I didn’t stop. I slammed into him, sending him crashing into the wall. His head hit the wood with a sickening crack, and he slumped to the floor. I didn’t check if he was alive. I simply didn’t care in that moment. I sprinted out of the house and into the night, the cold air burning my lungs. I ran until the lights of the house were far behind me, until the forest swallowed me whole. I don’t know what happened to Marilyn. I don’t know if Simon survived. All I know is… I’m not the same anymore. I can feel the green fire still inside me, whispering in my blood, changing me in ways I can’t yet understand. I’m not just Artur Amatis anymore. I’m something else. Something he created. Something he couldn’t control. (Part 2 will follow if wanted :))",

      "title": "CURSED REDDIT STORY",
      "content": "August 31, 2024. I've always loved reading horror stories. They fascinated me, especially those with a macabre plot twist. I enjoyed reading them while sipping my coffee, but ever since that damned incident last month, I haven't been able to open a single story again. That morning, as usual, I was browsing creepypasta subreddits while drinking my coffee. I'd practically read them all. But that day, something strange happened. Amid thousands of posts flooded with upvotes and comments, there was one story... with no likes, no comments. Completely forgotten. I clicked. I started reading. WARNING. The story was cliché. Nothing special. It seemed inspired by those old slasher films where teenagers get massacred. THE IRONY. Just another recycled story among so many. I finished reading and went to work. Another shitty day, with my boss yelling at me as usual. When I got home, I noticed something strange. The front door was slightly open. At first, I thought I'd forgotten to lock it. STOP. I entered cautiously. My town wasn't known for high crime rates. I searched the entire house. Nothing out of the ordinary. I tried to forget about it and carry on with my night. At 1 a.m., I woke up. The hallway light was flickering nonstop. \"Damn faulty wiring again...\" I muttered, going back to sleep. Five minutes later, I woke up startled by the sound of plates shattering in the kitchen. Horror clichés are pure fiction, RIGHT? I got up and went to the kitchen. Everything was a mess. I was organized. This wasn't normal. As I picked up the broken plates, I saw marks... of blood. Messages written: YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE READ THAT STORY. My stomach turned to ice. How did someone know? This was always my secret hobby. I screamed. I called the police. They arrived quickly. They collected blood samples. No signs of a break-in. The kitchen didn't even have a window. Days later, the results: the blood was mine. But how? I wasn't injured. I had no history of sleepwalking. I didn't do drugs. OR DID I? The police dismissed it as a prank. They warned me. But the messages kept coming. Every night, in different places: on the bathroom mirror, on the bedroom window. I WARNED YOU. And it wasn't just messages. \"Accidents\" that could have been fatal started happening—coincidentally. A brick fell out of nowhere, almost hitting me. A pitbull attacked me for no reason. I was nearly run over by a speeding car—I was the only pedestrian on the street. I slipped three times in the shower, with no explanation. And then my house... caught fire. No cause. I lost everything. Homeless, I got fired from my job. I had no peace. I moved back in with my parents, but I quickly realized I was putting them in danger. Now I'm writing this on my phone. If you're reading this, understand: sooner or later, I won't be able to escape. This thing will get me. There's no use fighting. The story I read... condemned me. And if you've read this far... YOU'RE NEXT.",

      "content": "In the forgotten wilderness of the forest of Caelmoor, where the light hesitated to penetrate and the air was thick as rotting flesh, She was betrayed—torn, mutilated, and left nameless, unburied. His hatred fermented in the bowels of the earth until, beneath a tomb of ancient bones, he found what should never have been unearthed: the Heart of Wrath. The artifact pulsed like a living tumor, each beat exuding a miasma of age-old rancor. Upon touching him, the rotting flesh of his corpse smoked, regenerating into a grotesque amalgam of viscera, exposed nerves, and blackened bones. She was reborn — but not as a woman. He was reborn as a walking altar of pain. His fury was so thick that it made the air sharp. The first traitors barely had time to scream. She tore them apart with her bare hands, plunging her fingers into their ribs, tearing them apart like wet paper until the exposed hearts fluttered between her fingers. Then, he devoured them while they were still hot, feeling the blood run down his chin and soak the ground. It wasn't enough. She skinned the still-living bodies, hung the bloody skins like funeral flags, and strung empty skulls on stakes, forming trails of horrors that snaked through the surrounding villages. Each new massacre was more savage, more creative in its brutality: entire families impaled alive, children sewn together with torn tendons, men forced to swallow their own eyes before having their insides pulled out like streamers of flesh. The Heart of Wrath, fused in his chest, pulsed in frenzy with each death, with each bloodbath. She became more monstrous—her arms thickening with twisted muscles, her eyes turning into slits that wept black pus. In the end, the villages were just heaps of putrid flesh, fields where the viscera ran like scarlet rivers. The smell of clotted blood permeated the earth, the sky and the soul of any unfortunate person who dared to breathe there. They say that you can still hear, on stormy nights, the wet and horrendous sound of hearts being ripped out, accompanied by a chorus of laments that will never find rest. Because She doesn't just seek revenge — She seeks to satisfy a hunger that will never be satisfied again. And if the Heart of Wrath feels the beating of your chest... it will guide It to you.",

      "title": "I Found a Letter From a Vietnam Veteran. Now I'm Seeing the Same Things He Did.",
      "content": "A few months ago, I moved into a small town in rural Ohio. The place was cheap a rundown little house that used to belong to a retired Vietnam veteran. They said he passed away in the nearby forest back in the '70s. The house was nearly empty except for some old furniture and dust. But on my first night, I found something strange. An old, folded letter tucked between the sofa cushions. I’m not sure why, but I felt like I had to read it. Here’s what it said: I lost my best friend in Vietnam... He said he found paradise. It was a strange day the last day I ever saw him. It happened during the Battle of Yawoting in Vietnam. A brutal, unforgiving war. The terror still clings to me. Guerrillas set up traps and killed my comrades silently. Day or night, it didn’t matter. They were like ghosts stalking us, studying us learning how we moved, how we lived, so they could kill us better. Every night we tried to rest, but the sun would rise again just to blind us with fresh fear. One by one, the ghosts took us. They were patient. Our lead officer got cocky. The next day, we found him ripped in half, painting the green ground crimson. They chewed through us slowly, savoring every moment, knowing if they made even a single sound, we would fill them with lead. Blood filled the lakes. Blood filled our minds. We barely slept. Our bodies twitched and trembled, our minds stretched thin, knowing death could come at any second. But at least... I had him. The one person who kept me sane. Angelo. My best friend. I met him during training free-spirited, fearless, a little rebellious. Everyone loved him. He once showed me a picture of his family: four smiling kids and a beautiful wife. \"I can’t wait to go home and wrap my arms around them,\" he said, smiling through tears. He never slacked. He trained hard, harder than any of us, but because of that he was always hungry constantly raiding the canteen. He had dreams. He had purpose. One night, deep in the jungle, the darkness thickened like fog. I stayed up on watch, exhausted but too scared to sleep. I asked Angelo to take the next shift. \"Angelo?\" He nodded too fast, unnaturally, like a puppet. Something felt wrong. But I was too tired to think about it. A few hours later, I heard him whispering. Over and over. Soft. Repeating. Like he was praying. At midnight, I heard him clearly: \"I found paradise. Come with me.\" I opened my eyes. I saw him sprinting into the jungle barefoot, fast, desperate. I followed, called his name, but he disappeared into the darkness. Gone. I stumbled back to our tent, shaking. His hammock was empty. All that remained was his hanging, chipped dog tag. We couldn't search in the dark. Too dangerous. When daylight came, we searched. No sign. No blood. No tracks. No Angelo. The war ended years later. I demanded an investigation. The CIA called it: \"MIA.\" Missing In Action. Some soldiers said he went mad. Others said he tried to escape hell. But his body was never found. When I came home, everything was gone. My family was distant. No girlfriend. No friends. Nothing. I tried drinking. I tried drugs. Nothing numbed it. Every night, I walked to a hilltop and smoked cigars under the moonlight. And that's when I started hearing them. Voices, soft and promising, whispering through the stars \"Follow us.\" They opened my eyes. They showed me. Angelo was right. He found paradise. I followed him there. You should too. When I finished reading the letter I took a picture of it to show to my friends, and I laughed it off. Crazy old soldier stuff, I thought. But last night... while I was sitting outside, smoking a cheap cigar or at least I thought it was a cigar and staring up at the moon, I swear I heard whispering. \"Follow us.\" I froze. Slowly, I looked over my shoulder... nothing. I checked the whole damn yard still nothing. Then I muttered to myself, \"Holy sht... this place is f*king haunted. And I'm here just trying to relax for once. I slipped the old letter back exactly where I found it. I didn’t want anything to do with that paranormal sht. A week later, I packed up and moved to a different town. But even now, I can’t shake the feeling. I still haven’t had a decent night’s sleep since. But atleast im starting to see his truth now.",

I was at the store getting snacks and drinks late one night and noticed the screen that shows all the sections of the building were all replaying wherever I was, it wasn't showing anyone or anything else, some of the footage looked like it was right behind me , after paying for my stuff I quickly ran home , I shut and locked the door, I tried to watch TV , read a book , clean up the house a bit, anything to get my mind off of this weird situation but even though I was in the privacy of my own home , I still felt that paranoia that someone or something was staring at me the whole time. The Day After I went to work, I'm a janitor in a warehouse , make sure everything is clean and working, and once again , I felt like I was being stalked. The Day After I went hiking , and again that same uneasy feeling swept over me. A couple days later I went to work again , I had to work overtime and there wasn't that much employees around that night , and yet again for like the millionth god damn time , I felt the exact same feeling , so I grabbed onto a metal pipe that was on the floor and swung it at whatever was behind me , at first I saw nothing, until the pipe made impact with an invisible force , when it hit the unknown thing , the creature was finally revealed , it looked like a person, but with rubbery, fake looking skin , and what I thought were its giant bugged out eyes were actually surveillance cameras, one felt out of its socket, and I decided to see if this really was the thing that had been following me by checking the footage , the first video was the footage of me from the store , one was me at home reading a book and two humanoid things were hanging upside down on the ceiling looking directly at me, one was of me at work the day prior, It showed me walking down the hall , and a headless man following behind me , there was one of me he in the forest during my hiking trip, it was filmed from a far , the camera panned from me to a nearby cave , in it a hunched over cloaked figure with a simillar, mask looking face and giant black camera lenses for eyes , looked up from the ground and smiled at the camera, with a giant toothless maw for a mouth , it let out a weird ghostly chuckle as it hopped around like a monkey , the last piece of footage was me walking down the hall , the camera turned to show a man with a creepy grin on his face , his eyes were two camera lenses , the footage ended when I hit the camera with the metal pipe. Not only did that footage confirm my fears but also told me there were more than one stalker and one... was still in the room with me.",

      "content": "When I was 10, I found a dusty NES cartridge at a yard sale. No label — just \"MARIO\" scratched into the plastic with what looked like a knife. The old man selling it gave it to me for free, but not before warning: \"Be careful which world you open.\" I thought it was just some bootleg copy of Super Mario Bros. When I popped it into my console, the screen flickered longer than normal. Finally, it loaded... but the title screen was wrong. Instead of the happy clouds and bright colors, the background was blood-red. Mario stood there, alone, head drooped, his sprite oddly stretched — arms too long, eyes just black holes. There were only two options: \"Start\" and \"Wake Up\". I pressed Start. The game loaded into World 1-1... or so I thought. The ground was cracked and blackened, pipes twisted like bones. Familiar Goombas staggered toward me, but they looked melted, their faces missing. When I tried to jump on one, Mario just... sank into it. The game glitched horribly — pixelated screams filled the air, though the NES wasn’t even hooked to speakers. I tried to turn it off, but the power button jammed. The screen flashed red again, this time a message appeared: \"TOO LATE.\" Mario’s sprite looked up at me directly now. His mouth stretched open unnaturally wide, a black, gaping void. He started running toward the screen, getting closer with every step. I swear I felt the air get colder in the room. Then the TV screen cracked — a single line right down the middle. The console finally shut off by itself. When I pulled the cartridge out, it was burning hot. I threw it outside into the trash. That night, I woke up at 3:33 a.m. to the sound of the Super Mario Bros. theme playing faintly somewhere in the house... but slower. Distorted. And I wasn’t alone in the room. I could see two black, hollow eyes staring from the corner. Waiting.",

May god be with you all. 6 DAYS UNTIL HELL... Hi, im Peter im writing to tell you that ive just won the lottery! Im extremely happy, and im saving the money in my college funds and a new gaming PC. I want to be a streamer so i think this is a great start! Hopefully you can watch my streams and i can chat with you all! Anyways im writing because ive been noticing that some stuff seems a little off? Its probably just me but the family barnhouse we have just dosent sit right with me? Im not sure but i did save 40000 to invest in crypto, so we will see how that goes! 5 DAYS UNTIL HELL... Im thinking of making art instead of gaming. Im not sure but ive started getting fascinated by art. My mother said that i should stick to gaming because i already bought the PC, but im not sure. We will see how everything turns out and im starting to believe that the crypto thing wasnt the best decision. Ive already done it so its too late now. 2 DAYS UNTIL HELL... Hey i took a little break from writing because i used the money to buy a 3 day vacation so i could sit back and relax. But the barn with the animals is so weird. Im not sure what it is it could be mind trickery but im not sure. The barn, it, i dont know it just seems so off. Im not sure what it is but it wont leave my mind. I will look into it. 1 DAY UNTIL HELL... DUDE SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY OFF, let me explain. I was walking into the barn and i swear on my life i saw something move. And noone was there. It was a red and black tall figure with eyes dripping with blood. IM NOT LYING SOMEONE NEEDS TO HELP ME. Its eating all the animals and they are getting infected 2 HOURS AGO MY FAVORITE AND MOST CALM PIG BIT ME. I need help i cant deal with this this is too much.

My whole country and possibly more is infected. Run they are fast. Hide they have impeccable senses. Fight, they are strong. Scream and make disturbing noises, they dont care. They are unstoppable. Im going to die soon i was somehow able to get the news on and 80% of the world is infected. The military have already come and all of them were added to the masters collection. I started it. Im the one that made this happen. I used some of the money and donated it to cancer treatment. Kind right? they used my money and accidentally created it. It escaped and not to cause panic they made their worst mistake. Did not tell anyone. No one but the top class people (leaders goverment etcetera.) know. So all of this happened im writing to say im sorry i didnt inspect further. I could have easily stopped it and now im going to die. Goodbye world.",

      "content": "After the chupacabra incident, we barely had time to breathe before another call came in. This time, from deep in the forests of Canada. A remote mining camp had gone silent. No radio, no calls, no signs of life. Locals whispered one word: Wendigo. Officially? The government blamed a snowstorm. Unofficially? They called us — M. C. you. We arrived just before sunset. The camp was shredded — cabins torn apart like paper. Blood everywhere, but barely any bodies. Only a few scraps of clothing frozen into the ice. No tracks. No sounds. The forest was wrong. Too still. Too quiet. We moved fast, sweeping through the ruins, weapons ready. We knew what we were dealing with — or at least we thought we did. The Wendigo isn’t just a monster. It’s a spirit — ancient, starved, pure hunger wrapped in a nightmare. It doesn’t just kill. It corrupts. It possesses. And sometimes... it leaves pieces of itself behind. Our lead tracker, Murphy, spotted the first sign — claw marks etched into a tree fifteen feet off the ground. Not normal claw marks, either. Long, thin, and burning cold to the touch, like the tree itself was being drained from the inside out. We heard it before we saw it — a low, keening wail that rattled in your teeth and made your blood go cold. Something moved between the trees, fast enough that we almost missed it. Long limbs, skin stretched thin over bone, and those eyes — hollow pits of black. We hit it with tranqs — normal ones didn’t work. We had to use specialized rounds: a cocktail of heavy sedatives, silver nitrate, and something they don't even let us know the name of. It still took five direct hits to bring it down. Even unconscious, it whispered. Not words. Feelings. Cold. Hunger. Despair. Murphy didn’t make it back. He disappeared during the extraction. We searched for hours but never found a body. Just his boots, frozen solid into the ice — standing upright, like he’d just stepped out of them. We got the creature contained. It’s locked away now in one of the deep-level vaults, far below where anyone can hear it scream. But sometimes, late at night, when I walk the lower halls... I still hear that wail. Calling for something. Or someone. Maybe Murphy. Maybe me. This job isn’t about killing monsters. It’s about making sure you never meet them. And it’s getting harder every day. Trust me — next time you’re alone in the woods, and you hear something whisper your name from the dark... Don’t answer. Ŋəvęř łĕþ ŷœűř ģæůřð ɗőẅŋ.",

      "content": "In the 1940s, there was a nurse named Evelyn who ran the infant ward of a small, isolated hospital. Locals remembered her as cold, mechanical — perfect on paper, but wrong somehow. Her uniform was spotless. Her hands, precise. Her smile, thin and brittle like old glass. Over the years, an unusual number of babies died under her care. Always the frailest ones, always with no clear explanation. Parents grieved. Doctors signed death certificates. No one dared question Evelyn. It was easier to believe in bad luck than in something darker. Then came Charlotte — a woman of influence and iron will. She gave birth to a healthy child at Evelyn’s hospital, but within days, her baby was dead. Unlike the others, Charlotte refused to accept the neat, quiet tragedy handed to her. At her child’s funeral, standing alone over the tiny grave, she whispered a curse — not in anger, but in grief so deep it scraped the marrow of her bones. The air itself seemed to recoil from her words. The ground split with hairline cracks. Something ancient and violent stirred. Reality frayed like rotting cloth, and through the tear, something came — something that had been waiting for the right opening, something hungry for pain. That night, Evelyn felt it. The curse found her in the nursery, where she sat alone, meticulously folding a blanket no one would ever use. The walls around her buckled, warping and bleeding shadows. Invisible hands gripped her, dragging her across the broken threshold between worlds. She tried to scream, but the curse forced every stolen cry, every mother’s sob, back down her throat. Her body twisted — joints cracking backward, bones warping under the strain. Her once-immaculate skin shriveled like paper left too close to a flame, her eyes sinking deep into hollows that wept black tears. The spirits of the lost children clung to her, stitched into her very flesh, their tiny hands clawing and pulling. Their sorrow became her marrow, their agony her blood. She became something else. Something the world had no name for. They call her The Cradle Witch now. Since then, stories have spread: of a gaunt figure cradling invisible infants in the abandoned wings of hospitals, of soft lullabies sung in a voice cracked and raw. Of a presence that comes to those drowning in guilt and shame. She doesn’t speak. She only rocks back and forth, humming a broken tune, until the crying stops. But it’s not the child’s cries that end. It’s yours. If you ever hear the soft creak of a rocking chair in an empty room, don’t look. If you see pale hands reaching out from the shadows, don’t answer. She’s still searching — for those who cannot carry their sorrow any longer — so she can carry it for them. Forever.",

      "content": "The Woman from the Village (Origin story of Hachishakusama) Deep within the heart of Japan, hidden by ancient forests, there once stood a forgotten village. In that village lived a woman known by all — kind, gentle, and always watching over the children. By day, she was a beacon of warmth. But by night... something changed. Whispers began to spread among the villagers. They spoke of shadows that stretched too long, of a heavy, distant thumping that echoed through the trees. Children spoke fearfully of a tall figure watching them from the darkness, her face obscured by a wide white hat. One night, a child vanished. By morning, he was found — alive, but pale and trembling with fear. What he told made the blood run cold: the kind woman had changed. She had grown impossibly tall, her arms thin like dead branches, her voice a low, chilling \"po... po... po...\" drifting through the forest. The village elders knew what had to be done. Without a word, they led the woman deep into the woods — farther than any map would go. She was forbidden to return. But she never truly disappeared... They say she still roams the forests, taller than any tree, waiting silently. If you wander too close to the old village and hear a faint \"po... po... po...\" in the night — it may already be too late. She is still searching. Still waiting. For the children who have forgotten her name. I translated this with chat gpt but kinda whrote it myself",

Like sometimes I am happy that this is a false religion and I am certain of it, then other times I lose faith and I am not sure whether it is a false religion. I then go to the false preacher and he reassures me that this false religion is the truest false religion. He then tells me that the reason that I keep questioning whether this religion isn't the false religion, is because I am living an ordinary life. In this false religion we must stray away from living an ordinary life. I do my best to not live an ordinary life but sometimes it's hard, as I am an ordinary person. He then tells me to let the five people bite my finger. I beg him not to order me to let the five people bite my finger, but he thinks its a necessary thing to do. After the process I will be reassured that this religion is a false religion. I know in the end that he is right. All my life I have been looking for the false religion and I am sure that i have found it. Then I go up to the 5 people, when I put my finger into the first person's mouth, he literally bites off my finger. Then as I am in pain, I put my bleeding bitten off finger into the second person's mouth, and my finger has come back. Then I put my new finger into the 3rd person's mouth, and it gets turned into a fish. Then I put my fishy finger into the 4th person's mouth, and its gets turned into a worm. Then I put my wormy finger into the 5th person's mouth, and it gets turned into nail. After this process I was finally sure that my religion is the false religion. Al parka is truly a false religion and any of you looking for a false religion, you should join Al parka. I have always wanted to join a false religion and here I am being part of one. I can't believe i have done it and I have always been afraid to go through with stuff. Yes I am now sure that Al parka is a false religion and whenever I get unsure whether it's not a false religion, I just look at my nail finger.",

      "title": "Asking for tips and opinions on my creepypasta",
      "content": "I wanted to create a creepypasta for fun, but am now wondering if it even classifies as one and if it is good in the eyes of others. This is my first time making one, and I would be happy to get some advice please. My Idea: I was thinking of a shapeshifting entity that would shapeshift into an anthropomorphic animal of the person's liking and appear in your room after waking up and be like: hello. I'm your new imaginary friend. He is only seen by the victim. The entity would ease the victim like a real friend, jet-neutral and distant but somewhat warm. This is a trap that makes the victim want to come closer. The closer something is to the entity, the faster it can absorb your vitality. Each day you would feel weaker and weaker, until your last night. That night the entity will expose his intentions before you die of unknown causes, making you wonder if he really was all that bad since he was a TRUE friend, but one that killed you slowly. The next day the entity would eat your body, leaving no evidence, and disappear until hungering again. Short story example: Title: The Friend in the Fur It starts the night after a dream. You don’t remember the dream, just the soft click of your bedroom door opening — and there he is. Standing in the half-dark, a figure shaped like the animal you always wanted for a friend when you were little. Soft fur, kind eyes, the perfect voice: \"Hello. I'm your new imaginary friend.\" You laugh. You think you're dreaming. You're not. No one else sees him. No one else can. At first, he's harmless — distant, even polite. He sits quietly at the edge of your room, smiling faintly, always at a respectful distance. He asks nothing from you. He listens better than any human friend ever could. Warm but...hollow, somehow. And every day after, you wake up a little weaker. A little slower. Your body aching in ways it never has before. Doctors shrug. Blood tests are fine. Maybe you're just tired, they say. Maybe it's all in your head. You feel yourself slipping away. You start needing the Friend more. His presence is comforting even as it drains you. He never pushes, but he’s always closer than before — at your bedside, within arm’s reach. You don't fight it. You can’t. On the last night, when you can barely lift your head from the pillow, he sits next to you and leans in, almost tenderly. \"I'm so glad we got to know each other,\" he whispers. \"You were never really alone. Not until now.\" And as your heart stutters its last, you wonder — was he really so bad? A true friend, until the end. The next morning, your bed is empty. The room is clean. You're gone. And somewhere, not far away, the Friend licks clean claws and waits for the next lonely soul to dream. My opinion: It taps in to the feeling of lonelyness and explores the idea of fals safty. Unlike most creepypastas (I think) it is less horrific and violent. If you were the victim, you'd feel safe. You'd trust \"the\" Friend. You might even be grateful for him. And then, in the end, you die still wondering if it was a betrayal... or just somthing you should be happy about, since it listened like no other friend could.",

      "content": "It was late April in Mexico. The heat clung to everything — thick, heavy, and inescapable. Locals in the smaller villages spoke in hushed tones about a creature they called El Chupacabra — \"goat sucker\" in Spanish. Rumors spread faster than wildfire. Livestock were found drained of blood, their bodies left stiff and cold under the scorching sun. Strange footprints littered the dusty earth. No government official wanted to touch it. Too messy. Too dangerous. So they called us: the M. C. you. — Mobile Cryptid Unit. We specialize in hunting what most people think are just myths. Our job isn’t glamorous. It’s grueling, thankless, and usually ends in bruises — if we’re lucky. We've seen things no one would believe. Things no one should believe. And yet, here we were again. We tracked the creature for two nights straight, barely sleeping, always moving. It was fast — faster than anything that size should be. Small, hairless, and hunched, it resembled a coyote at first glance... but wrong. Wrong in ways you couldn’t explain without sounding insane. Its eyes caught our flashlight beams and reflected them back like twin silver mirrors. It didn’t growl like a dog or a cat. Its low rumble vibrated in your chest like the hum of broken machinery. On the third night, we set the trap. Three tranquilizer darts punched into its flank before it finally dropped. Even sedated, it writhed and snapped with feral rage. It took six of us — strong, trained field agents — just to hoist it into the reinforced transport cage. The stench it gave off was indescribable, a mix of wet rust, sour earth, and rotting meat. You don't forget a smell like that. We transported it to containment at HQ. There, deep underground, we maintain dozens of artificial ecosystems — thick jungles, barren deserts, icy tundras — all hidden from the world above. Each environment is tailored to its inhabitant, custom-built to keep cryptids alive but isolated. Alive... and secret. I can’t tell you my name. Clearance levels, you understand. But you need to know: monsters are real. Always have been. Bigfoot lurking in misty forests. Unicorns — not the shimmering beauties you imagine, but violent, territorial beasts. Lizard men slipping through sewers beneath your cities. Arby's — well, that's a different kind of monster. The Loch Ness Monster, sliding silently through black waters. Shadow people, whispering from the corners of your room. Mothman, Skinwalkers, and others whose names haven't even made it into your nightmares yet. If you ever feel like you’re being watched... you are. And if you comfort yourself with the thought that disbelief protects you — that skepticism keeps you safe — let me tell you: It doesn’t. Reality doesn't need your belief to exist. The dark corners of the world don't care whether or not you think they're real they are they kill and it's my job to stop them This? This is only the beginning. Ŋəvęř łĕþ ŷœűř ģæůřð ɗőẅŋ.þĥəŷ ẅæṭçĥ ĕvêřỳ ţįmĕ Ŋəvęř ťřỳ þœ ĥįđə ÞĤÆŶ ŞĔƏ ŶŒŮ",

      "content": "Caleb first notices the smell before anything else. It is metallic, sour, clinging to the inside of his nose like an infection. The first fish appears tucked inside his mailbox, neatly folded like a letter. Blood drips onto his electricity bill. No one sees it delivered. No fingerprints. No security footage. The second is left on his car seat, scales pressed flat against the upholstery. By the third, dangling from his showerhead like a glistening pendulum, Caleb understands he is being sent a message. But not one he knows how to read. They are not threats. They are puzzles. Each herring is slightly different. A different size, a different stage of decay, a different faint mark carved into the side. A pattern, almost, but incomplete. Caleb becomes obsessed. He charts them on his kitchen wall. Measures them. Photographs them. Sleeps beside them, waiting for whoever is delivering them to reveal themselves. The number 13 dominates his thoughts. Thirteen herrings. Thirteen clues. Thirteen days. He barely notices how the outside world starts slipping. Street signs flicker between familiar and nonsense words. Neighbors he has known for years cross the street to avoid him, mouths moving but making no sound. The moon changes shape, some nights a thin red ring, others an impossible slumped rectangle. Caleb tells himself to hold on until the thirteenth. The thirteenth fish arrives. It is massive, almost human-sized, and left sprawled across his bed like a grotesque offering. Its skin is carved with symbols he recognizes from his dreams: spirals, knives, endless corridors. This is it. The final sign. The end. But nothing happens. No answer. No escape. The house grows hot and small. The floors buckle. The walls bleed salt water. The clocks melt into formless gobs on the walls. And then he realizes there is a fourteenth fish. It is not delivered. It is inside him. Something has been building all along, quiet and patient and swelling. A wrongness seeded inside his body, threading into his veins. He feels it when he closes his eyes. A twitch beneath his ribs. A cold slithering up his spine. The thirteenth herrings were never the curse. They were the warnings. The fourteenth is transformation.",

      "content": "A while ago, I found this obscure website called dalediddles.com. It was a weird, yet funny website, made by some guy named Dale, and all you could do was wait for Dale to come online. Several people would wait in the \"Dale Que,\" and eventually, when Dale would come online, he would talk to everyone, kinda like omegle as they all got excited to be in his presence. And if you were lucky, Dale would choose you to talk to him. Since I discovered dalediddles.com, I have occasionally gotten on, sometimes chatted with people in the Dale Que, and seen Dale a couple times, but one day, it was different. I got home from school that day, about to hop on dalediddles.com, when something was different. I clicked on the website, but instead of seeing the 8-bit image of Dale saying \"Dale diddles... Dot com!\" It was replaced with a scarier Dale saying in a demonic voice \"Dale DIES dot com!\" Once the website loaded, everything had the same format, but it was all red and black. There was nobody in the \"Evil Dale Que,\" and instead of the Dale Cam saying \"Waiting for Dale to come online,\" it read, \"Waiting for Demon Dale to come online.\" It didn't take long for it to happen. Demon Dale finally showed up, and he was terrifying. He looked just like Dale (skinny guy, man bun, chinstrap beard), but he looked more like a demon! Demon Dale had red skin, 2 large black horns and glowing red eyes! As I was screaming, Demons Dale said \"Hi, I'm DEMON DALE!\" And then he killed me.",

Everyone looks down at me and it's good, it's all good. Not being important has it's own advantages you know, you are literally invisible and no one would really care. Only the important people matter in this world, and only they are watched and observed. I need more ghosts to breath and I can only breath in ghosts, and I am running out. So I go find someone and I find someone important, the important person doesn't want me near him. Then as I stab him, this important person knows that I am unimportant. Being unimportant means that my actions are of no importance. So this important guy was depressed that I made him unimportant and his death will now go unnoticed. His spirit will be my oxygen for a month. My lungs can only take in ghosts and when I breath out, I breath out there sins and bad actions. So there is some benefits to mister breathing in ghosts. Then when the month ends I need to find another person. Then I find an important woman and she sees me walking towards her. She shouts at me to stay clear from her. I stab her and she is only sad because she know my actions will not take notice from anyone. When an unimportant person does something, no one cares about it. I have got her spirit to breath for a month and I breath out her sins and bad actions. I have always been unimportant and it can be very lonely but you get use to it. Everyone wants to be important. Everyone wants their actions to be noticed. Then when I found another important individual, I killed him. As usual no one cared because I am unimportant. When I started to breath in his ghostly spirit, I refused to breath out his sins. His sins were atrocious and they needed to stay with him. So i killed another important person and I started to breath in his spirit instead. Some sins don't deserve to breathed out, and there are times where I want to know what it's like to be important. Then again I will miss the freedom of being unimportant as nobody cares about what I do or where I go.",

      "title": "The Red Window",
      "content": "Everything I’m about to say might sound made up, though there’s nothing supernatural here. Whether to believe me or not is entirely up to you. Let me begin my story.* It was evening, around 7 PM. I was swinging on the playground as usual while my brother hung out with his friends. We were in our neighborhood courtyard, the one everyone calls \"Green Zone\" because of its old, broken, but still green swings and slides. I was listening to music, and my friend was on the swing next to me. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary—there were about ten of us there. At one point, I heard swearing from a window but didn’t pay much attention. I figured someone was just arguing—it never crossed my mind they were targeting us. Then, suddenly, I noticed everyone was running. My brother and I had a rule—he wouldn’t ditch me without warning. A few seconds later, I heard shouts: \"Nika, run!\" I jumped off the swing and took off sprinting—like I was in a P. E. race, not a casual evening. We turned the corner toward the dormitory where some of our friends lived, including my brother and me. Everyone was screaming, \"He’s got a knife!\" and our friend Artyom ran into the kitchen, looking for \"a knife sharper than his\"—his exact words. When I asked what happened, they told me: from Window #3 on the first floor, a stranger in a Billy the Puppet mask (from Saw) had been staring at us. He wasn’t just watching—he was screaming obscenities, making crude gestures, and filming us on his phone. When the guys noticed him, Artyom walked right up and yelled, \"Dude, this isn’t funny!\"—bold but reckless. The second he did, the stranger slid a real kitchen knife through the window. At first, we thought it was fake… until the blade glinted under the streetlight. It moved unnaturally, like he was tracing patterns on the glass, making that awful, grating sound—then suddenly, it was pointed straight at us. By the time Artyom came back with a knife from the kitchen, the window was empty. Just a thick red curtain, blocking any view inside. The man had vanished—no trace, no recordings, no witnesses. Just us. We asked a woman passing by if anyone lived there. Her answer chilled us: \"That apartment’s been empty for years.\" Now it felt like a horror movie cliché—was this a psycho, a ghost, or some collective hallucination? Days later, we still don’t know. We avoid that window. Sometimes, the curtain moves on its own, and I swear I see the mask’s silhouette—but when others look, there’s nothing. Then, yesterday, we found the mask under that window. A note was glued to it: \"The game isn’t over.\" We burned it. The next morning, a clown mask appeared on our dorm windowsill. Another note: \"You broke the rules.\"* It’s still hanging in our hallway. Sometimes, I feel it turning to watch us. But that’s impossible… right?..",

      "content": "Elias’s backyard had this crabapple tree that was basically useless. It flowered like mad every spring, bright pink, but never actually produced any decent apples. By late summer, its leaves were already dying off, making a mess on the lawn he rarely bothered with. It was back there, near the dodgy brick wall that shed mortar like dandruff, by the alley, that he found the weird spot. It wasn't like in the movies, no swirling colours or anything. It was just… still. A patch of air, about the size of a small suitcase standing on its end, where nothing moved. You could see dust floating around everywhere else, but it just stopped dead when it reached the edge of this spot. He saw a fly buzz right up to it and then just veer off like it hit a window, but there was nothing there. Sounds seemed quieter if you were listening through it, too – the traffic noise, birds, everything got muffled. He found it when he dropped a screw trying to fix a fence panel. He crouched down and looked right at it. It didn't hum or glow or feel hot or cold. It was just… missing. Like someone had cut a chunk right out of the air. He poked at it. His finger met something weird – not solid, but like pushing into really thick jelly, only dry. He pulled his hand back fast. ‘‘What the hell?’’ He watched it for a few days. He threw little stones at it; they'd hit the edge and just drop. He tried shining a torch into it, but the light just stopped, didn't bounce off or go through. It just soaked everything up: light, sound, movement. A completely dead zone in the middle of everything else. One evening, the sun was going down, making everything look orange, and he thought he saw something in the patch. Not creatures or another place. It looked more like when you stir up mud in water, that sort of cloudy swirl. Shapes, pale like dust, moved really slowly inside. Sometimes they'd almost look like things he vaguely remembered – the shape of a handle from an old mug, the outline of a bird, a flash of light like off his grandad's glasses. Just faint hints. Leftover images. It didn't feel dangerous at first, just really strange. He got the feeling whatever was in there belonged there, like the noise the fridge makes or the house creaking. Normal background stuff you don't notice. He reached out again, pushing his fingers against that weird edge. He kept them there this time, trying to just feel it. That’s when the weirdest thing happened, and it wasn’t about the patch, it was about him. He suddenly remembered being a little kid, hiding behind this same tree, upset because he’d lost a toy car. He could almost feel the rough bark – like old, dry leather – against his cheek and see the exact green colour of the car. As soon as the memory hit him, a little flicker of that same green colour swirled in the dusty stuff in the patch, then vanished. He tried again. A tight feeling, like he’d swallowed ice, started low in his gut. He thought about a row he’d had with his sister, the nasty things they’d said. A sharp, broken-looking shape flashed inside the patch, lingering a bit longer this time. He thought about this tune he kept trying to remember but couldn't quite get. A sort of wavy, silvery pattern appeared, and it seemed to pulse faintly, drawing his eye. He realised it wasn't just a window. It was feeding. ‘‘Feeding’’. The shapes weren't just echoes; they were the remains of thoughts, feelings, moments that had happened there, being slowly broken down, digested by the stillness. And now, it had noticed him. He pulled his hand back, but the feeling didn't stop. It was like a faint static cling, not on his skin, but on his thoughts. He tried thinking about what he'd have for dinner, but the image flickered, replaced for a second by the dusty swirl inside the patch. He tried remembering his mum's face, and for a terrifying moment, the memory felt thin, distant, like it was being pulled away from him towards the stillness behind the crabapple tree. The patch wasn't just a thin spot where you could see the past getting processed. It was the processor itself. And it was hungry. It had tasted his memories, his emotions. He looked at it again, and the dusty shapes inside seemed clearer now, sharper. He could almost make out the green toy car, the jagged edges of the argument, the silver curve of the melody. They weren't just echoes anymore. They were his echoes, added to the collection. He backed away slowly, his breath catching in his throat. It wasn't a portal to somewhere else. It was an endpoint. A place where things ended up, stripped down to faint whispers and then… nothing. And it knew him now. He could feel it, a persistent tugging at the edges of his mind, like trying to remember something you know you've forgotten. He had a horrible feeling that sooner or later, it wouldn't just be his memories it was pulling on. The stillness wasn't empty. It was waiting…",

And I don’t mean lookalikes or people altered to resemble me—these are clones. It took a while for people to understand what was happening. At first, they assumed I was part of a set of twins. But now that the body count has reached 72, that theory is obviously absurd. Both of my parents have passed away, and I’m an only child. In the beginning, the remains were barely recognizable—just garbage bags filled with what looked like meat, hidden deep in the woods. But over time, whatever is doing this has grown bolder, dumping the bodies in public places I frequent. Authorities have confirmed the bodies are human, but many are missing vital organs—usually the brain, lungs, but sometimes limbs are absent as well. It’s also believed that not all of them were killed… assuming they were ever truly alive to begin with. The police are investigating but progress in the case has stagnated. Besides the fact that bodies keep popping up. We do fear that eventually one of the bodies will actually be me so I have been forced to undergo daily surveillance and wellness checks. Along with constant harassment from news outlets trying to get a fresh scoop but instead of letting a bunch of shameless ghouls profit off of me I'm just going to inform the people directly. Feel free to ask me anything.",

      "content": "I ain’t even sure how long I’ve been on this damn train anymore. At first, it felt normal. Just another late ride home after pulling a double. I remember checking my phone — 12:47 AM. I was in the last car, slumped near the window, headphones in, watching the lights blur past outside. But then the announcements stopped making sense. “Next stop… Reverie Junction.” Ain’t never heard of that place before, and I’ve lived in this city my whole life. I figured I was half-asleep or maybe hopped on the wrong line, but nah. I checked the map above the doors. Same route. Same stops. Only… Reverie Junction wasn’t there. I shrugged it off at first. Figured I missed my stop, I’d just hop off and grab a ride back. But I never got the chance. Every time we slowed down, I thought, this is it. But the doors never opened. Sometimes I’d see the same stations blur by again — Eastwood, Brighton, and Harborview. Over and over. At least five times I seen that same graffiti on the Harborview bench: a smiley face with no eyes. I started counting. Harborview hit number nine before I stopped counting. There were other people on the train at first. A few, anyway. Old guy in a suit, girl with pink hair, a mother with her sleeping kid. I even asked the old guy what stop he was getting off at. He looked at me confused and said, “Didn’t we already pass that?” Then he was gone. Like, not “got off the train” gone. I mean, I blinked — and poof. Empty seat. No footsteps. Nothing. The girl with the pink hair? She was just standing near the door one minute, head against the glass… next time I looked, her reflection was still there — but she wasn’t. Now it’s just me. Sometimes the intercom crackles, and I swear I hear someone breathing. Not talking. Just slow, steady breathing, like they’re trying not ta be heard. The lights flicker a lot now. And outside the windows, the world looks… wrong. The tracks are lined with trees, but the trees are moving. Not passing by — like, they sway toward the train. Like they’re reaching. I tried pulling the emergency brake. Nothing happened. I kicked at the doors, tried prying them open. All I got was this weird static ringing in my ears. Food’s gone. My phone’s dead. I tried writing the date on the back of a receipt just to keep track, but the ink fades by morning. Every time. I don’t even sleep anymore. Every time I close my eyes, I dream of tracks twisting into a spiral, and the train just diving into it, deeper and deeper. If you ever hear of Reverie Junction, don’t get on that train. And if you’re already on it… You might be the next one to disappear. Because the last stop? It never comes.",

      "content": "I was scrolling through the channels on my cable TV , just kind of channel surfing, I noticed on Cartoon Network/Adult Swim it was playing an episode of The Amazing World of Gumball, odd considering it was late at night , not even close to the morning, I assumed either it was a mistake or possibly a parody episode , I selected it just to see what episode it was , there wasn't anything else to watch so I figured why not, the intro wasn't there, it just jumped straight into the title card, instead of the normal font and background it was pure black with poorly scribbled words reading \"The Tormented\" , because of its low quality and it seeming like it was trying to be scary , I thought to myself \"yep , this was a parody episode\" , the episode faded in to a shot of the living room , but it looked like someone just took images of the background and characters and put them there, like a crappy online recreation of an episode or something , the image of the living room was blurry and pixelated , and the only character on screen was Richard , a low quality png of Richard that is , it was a picture of him crying, and although at first there was no audio, all of the sudden there was audio , something that sounded like low pitched crying, but it just sounded like someone in the corner of a room, a very quiet sounding audio recording, along with what sounded like someone banging on metal, this went on for quite a while , the sound of the crying and the banging metal started to unnerve me a little bit , I started looking behind me and jumping at the slightest noise from the other rooms in the house , like that feeling you get when you watch a horror movie and feel like there's a ghost in your room. after a long time of that scene playing the scene changed to an even more unsettling visual , a close up of another png, this time being Gumball but his face was covered in lines and scribbles , the saturation had been turned up, and there was extra shading added, his eyes had been blacked out and he had a giant open frown scribbled onto his face, the backdrop was a greyish blue color, and much like the previous sceen this stayed on screen for a while, the audio being the same metal clashing sound from before, once again I was just very unsettled, again after a while something new finally happened but not in a good way , the image stayed the same but now the audio that played was a loud ear piercing ringing sound , I changed the channel quickly , and even after I did my ears were still hurting, I checked to see if that episode was still playing but to my surprise , it was gone , in its place was an episode of Rick and Morty, the rest of the night I was trying to figure out what I had seen, a hacking? , haunting? , Prank? , maybe I was just making stuff up from sleep deprivation. That Night I couldn't get sleep, I kept on thinking of the audio, and I had to turn on a light eventually because I would start seeing things in the dark. Whatever that episode was, it just left me with a feeling I was being watched.",

      "content": "TW: Suicide - 2/4/44 It’s been 12 days since the bombs were dropped. I figured keeping a journal would help keep me sane. Physically I’m fine. We have enough food to keep us alive. For now. Rachel says she isn’t feeling well. I gave her some Tylenol and it worked only for an hour or so. I told her to take some more. She spends most of the day sleeping. Harold is about as hopeful as I am. He’s putting on a brave face for Ellie. But I know him. He’s as scared as I am. But I’d hate to see them fall apart. They just got married a week before this all happened. Harold’s spending most of his time sitting next to the radio. He keeps fiddling with the buttons, as if he knows what he’s doing. All he ever gets back is static. Sometimes it’s louder than other times but that’s all we hear. Our gun has three bullets - 2/11/44 I heard Ellie singing yesterday. Some old song from the 20s “Oooo… blinded by the lights… I’m not sleeping… feel your touch…” That one line over and over again. I hear a bit of laughter and when I peek into their room I see Harold dancing around, laughing with her. It made me smile. Which is a rarity these days. Rachel hasn’t been feeling a lot better. I slept by her the other night. It was peaceful, reminded me a bit of before we had to leave home. It’s odd, really. I know we’re in the same city but down here… just feels like another world. We still have enough food. Our gun has three bullets - 2/20/44 Every day is starting to feel the same. Rachel sleeping, Harold messing with the radio, Ellie singing to herself. Every so often we’d play card games together but it’s not fun anymore. We’ve basically all mastered the few card games we know. Go fish… war… poker… that’s it. I’ve taken to playing solitaire by myself while the others do their thing. But still it’s not the same. Our gun has three bullets. - 3/1/44 Our generator is running out of gas. Food is starting to get low. I’ve yet to tell Rachel any of this. Speaking of Rachel she’s not getting any better. I used the last of the Tylenol. It wasn’t enough. Didn’t seem to help at all. Harold wants to leave the Bunker. All of us are telling him it’s a bad idea. He thinks he can take the gas mask we have and just stroll out there, but I’m not even sure it will work. He said verbatim: “If there’s even a chance of there being supplies up there I’ll take it.” Ellie was literally on her knees begging him not to go. He finally saw reason and said he’ll stay. Our gun has three bullets. - 3/44 Harold left. The stubborn bastard took the gas mask, the flashlight and just left. He left a note saying he’ll be back in a day. Ellie spent the whole day in bed crying. It broke my soul seeing her fall apart. As furious as I am right now, maybe if he does come back it will be worth it. Maybe he’ll get medicine for Rachel. Our gun has three bullets - 3/44 The box of cards fell apart. Cards are all over the floor. I can’t be bothered to pick them up. Rachel has gotten worse. She’s started to cough up blood. Harold needs to come back. HE HAS TO. No way he’d just leave for the sake of it. No. Don’t think like that. He’s coming back. Rachel will be fine. Ellie will be ok. It’s ok. I’m fine. He’s coming back. He’s coming back. Our gun has three bullets. - 3/44 Rachel hasn’t woken up yet. I’m scared. Ellie hasn’t left her room yet. Harold hasn’t come back yet Our gun has three bullets. - 3/44 Rachel isn’t awake. I slept beside her again last night. It felt different. I didn’t feel like it used to. We weren’t in our home before this all happened. We were just in a bunker. Harold hasn’t come back yet. I finally checked on Ellie today. I found her in her room. She was on the floor. Our gun has two bullets. - Rachel is still asleep. She was always a heavy sleeper. I sang a little song to her while she slept. It was nice. I’m not sure what to do with Ellie. The whole bunker is starting to smell. Our gun has two bullets. - Harold came back. He came back today With nothing. Nothing. NOTHING That stupid fucking bastard just came back like it was NOTHING! I did what I needed to. Our gun has one bullet - I’m leaving today. Me and Rachel are going to go out of this bunker. It will be beautiful. Harold and Ellie will stay here. I’m sure they’ll be happy together. I’ll pick her up and go. It will be beautiful. Beautiful. When she wakes up she’ll smile with me.",

Но под дъската не пише уроци за Възраждането. Там стои единствената истина, написана с креда от миналото: „Историята се повтаря... когато я разказва Тишо.\" Учениците го избягват, не защото не разбират Руско-турската война, а защото някои от тях просто не се връщат вкъщи. Тишо не просто учи история. Той я пише - с вилица и нож. През деня запотен човек с неясен диалект, разказващ с плам за „българщината\". През нощта - човекът, чийто фризер никога не е празен. Учителската стая мирише на чесън и страх. Родителите задават въпроси, но директорът мълчи. - „Той си е малко странен, ама има резултати по матури...\" А на дъното на един стар дневник, с изтъркани страници, някой е написал с молив: „Тишо не преподава история.

At first I allowed you to sleep in my own home as you found yourself homeless horny Rooney, I thought you would be grateful but you have just ended up making a mockery of me. You first slept with my sofa and my sofa came back to life and I then had to kill it. I thought you were sincere with your apology but you clearly weren't. Then in the park pond you started sleeping with the water horny Rooney, and I couldn't believe it. How could sleep with the park pond and what was so attractive about the water in the park? Then I again I guess that's why they call you horny Rooney. Watery babies started to form as this was the creation of you sleeping with the water in the pond. All those babies that formed from you and they water, they were only alive for a couple of minutes until they all died. It was a terrible sight to see and I had hoped you had learnt your lesson, then again you are horny Rooney. Then you pushed it further horny Rooney by sleeping with someone's house. You made a hole in the brick and you slept with it. Horny Rooney how could you and those people lived in a hellish house ever since. Their house was moving around and it became a whacky house where things would change and move around. It had to be demolished because their house was alive. You made a whole family homeless by sleeping with it, horny Rooney how could you be so naughty. You never learn do you and you seem to keep doing it. Saying sorry won't save you forever. Then when I thought that you couldn't get any lower horny Rooney, you had to go lower didn't you. You had to reproduce with the air and contaminate the whole air that every living thing needed. Horny Rooney how could be so selfish and greedy, you are nor sorry and you are spoiled. Whenever we breath the air, we are also breathing in creatures made from air that are your children. Why did you do it and you could have slept with anything else but you didn't. Horny Rooney your air children are now reproducing with other things, the world is doomed..",

      "content": "Iwas about ten years old when it first happened. My parents had sent me to my grandfather’s place for the weekend because they were going away. I didn’t really like him, he was always stern, and I never felt like he liked me. But back then, I had no choice. My grandfather's house was old, dark, and always smelled a bit like rotten wood and dust. I still remember walking up the stairs and settling into the room that was meant for me. It was always the same: an old bed, a stiff, uncomfortable chair, and the massive wardrobe in the corner that always creaked, as if it was breathing from the inside. That first night, I heard it – a faint, irregular scraping sound. It came from the hallway. I thought it was the wind or maybe the old house ghost people sometimes talked about. But the longer I listened, the clearer it became – it was footsteps. Slow, heavy footsteps, drawing nearer to the room. I pulled the covers over my head and tried to stay quiet, but I couldn’t stop listening. The footsteps came closer, and then… it suddenly went silent. A heavy breath, and then a cold, black hand slid under the door. I couldn’t see anything, but I could hear it dragging across the floor as the hand moved. I jumped out of bed, ran to the door, and screamed for my grandfather. But when I entered the room, no one was there. Everything was quiet. No scraping, no hand under the door. Everything was just as it had always been. I thought it was a nightmare. But over the next few nights, it got worse. I heard the footsteps more clearly each time, getting closer. And eventually, the furniture started to move. The chair where my grandfather always sat began rocking by itself. And the scraping continued, as though someone was trying to crawl out of the wardrobe. One particularly cold night, when I was back in the room, I heard the wardrobe open. A dull, slow squeak. I went closer and saw the wardrobe open by itself, even though no one was there. I knew I was about to see something, but what I saw, I couldn’t understand. There, in the wardrobe, stood my grandfather. But he didn’t look like the man I knew. His face was twisted, pale, and lifeless, his eyes wide and empty. He didn’t move, but he stared at me, as though waiting for me. Then, with a soft crack, his face began to twist even further, as though his skin was tearing apart. His eyes rolled back, and a cold, hollow laugh filled the room. I ran out of the room, stumbled down the stairs, and barricaded myself in the living room. When I called my parents the next morning and told them what happened, they just laughed and told me not to make such a fuss. “It’s just a child’s imagination,” my mom said. “You’ve been keeping too much to yourself.” But I knew what I’d seen. And the worst realization came later – my grandfather was never really dead. Not in the way you’d expect. Something had stayed behind from him, something dark that had settled in the corners of his house. No one believed me. And that was the worst part. Because it kept happening, every time I was in that house. But no one ever belived me.",

      "content": "First The moment I stepped into the corridor, reality buckled like a heat-wrapped film. I ran, my flashlight beam fracturing into prisms, painting the corridors with colors that didn’t exist. The mall wasn’t the mall anymore. The hallways twisted like intestines, walls glistening with a sheen that pulsed like breathing flesh. Clocks hung from the ceiling, their faces liquefied, hands spinning backward, then forward, spiraling into impossible knots. My footsteps echoed, but they weren’t mine alone. Others joined—too many, out of rhythm, some skittering like insects, others heavy as stone. I passed a storefront, its glass now a mirror, and saw not one reflection, but hundreds, crowding the surface. Their faces melted, mouths screamed silently, eyes blooming like flowers of black light. The air tasted of ash and static, and the lights flickered in patterns that carved shapes into my vision—spirals, fractals, things that shouldn’t be seen. I stumbled into the food court, now a cavern of impossible geometry. Tables floated in mid-air, their legs twisting and curling like roots; chairs sprouted thorns of glass that shimmered in the dim light. In the center stood another me, his uniform shredded, skin translucent, veins glowing like constellations. His head lolled unnaturally, neck bending at angles that made my stomach churn. He turned toward me, and his eyes were not voids but endless depths, swirling with stars that pulsed in time with my heartbeat. I froze, horrified and mesmerized, as it stared back at me—through me, as though it knew something I didn’t. “You’re late,” he said, his voice a chorus of mine, layered with tones that made my skull throb. His mouth split wider, teeth spiraling inward like the jaws of a black hole, pulling at the very air around us. “They’re here. The ones who are you. The ones who aren’t. Time’s a tapestry—and you’re the tear.” I screamed, my voice unraveling into threads of light that floated upward. I ran, the mall folding in on itself, corridors looping into Mobius strips, doors opening to ceilings, to voids, to versions of the food court where the other mes waited. One grabbed me, his hand cold as deep space, fingers sinking into my arm like roots. ‘Don’t look at the stars,’ he whispered, his face collapsing into a swirl of colors that burned my retinas like poison. I struggled, my arm locked in his grip, skin sizzling as the roots burrowed deeper. And then—a flash—I tore free, my skin peeling away in ribbons of light. Somehow, I reached the parking lot. The sky was a wound, stars pulsing like infected sores, constellations whispering my name in languages older than bone. My car sat where I left it, but its reflection in the asphalt split into a dozen shadows—each with a different me inside. One clawed at the glass. Another grinned, teeth too many. One just wept, eyes static-blurred. I got in. The engine groaned like it knew the road was wrong. I drove, the road stretching into infinity, the horizon folding upward like a wave. I’m home now, but home isn’t right. The walls shimmer, the mirrors show faces that aren’t mine but are. I checked my apartment’s security camera feed. There I am, standing in the hallway, my body a silhouette of writhing shapes, my eyes leaking light. Behind me, the shadow is taller, its edges blooming into fractals that swallow the frame. I’m inside, typing this, but I hear footsteps in the hall, too many, all mine. I don’t know what I am anymore. But I know I’m not alone.",

My mother is begging me to not force to marry this man as he will abuse, all I care about is having good genes and a good life filled with luxuries. My mother has always been the type of of person who doesn't need luxuries and living the high life, but I do and I don't want to struggle. My mother is crying and begging to me to allow her to marry who she wants. Then when my mother ran away and I was furious. How could she run away from her son and I was on the look out. I was so angry that I wasn't sure what I was going to do with her when I found her. Then suddenly I saw my mother with a guy with terrible genes. I was disgusted by her and even more disgusted that she wanted to be with him. I will not allow my mother to be with someone like that, and my body changed for a bit and it was similar to the guy she was dating. I then kidnapped my mother and I was so angry with her, that I had to discipline her. I turned that guy into a pig and I gave him to my mother. I mocked her and told her to sleep with him now. I shouted and slapped my mother for refusing to marry the guy I wanted her to marry, I wanted her to marry someone with great genes. Then one day I woke up and I was temporarily half pig and half human, I went down to my mother and I screamed at her. She started to have feelings for the pig because the pig use to be the guy she truly wanted to be with. I had to kill the pig and I fed people with it, and I made my mother serve them while she was crying. She will marry who I want her to marry because I want good genes and I need to have a good life. Yes she will be abused by this guy but sometimes you have to have sacrifices. I need to have good genes and I need to have success. Sorry mother you will marry this guy and you will persevere.",

Although most of the \"art\" pieces in the museum were nonsensical and idiotic in nature, one stood out as something with true meaning, despite the ethics being very questionable , a table with various tools , items and weapons laying on top , a flash card held up by a camera facing the audience read \"Cruelty\" presumably the name of the art piece , the actors for the performance was the artist himself , a young man with short black hair and wearing a greenish brown vest , with a magenta scarf , and a stoic looking woman in a white gown, she had long brown hair and a serious looking expression on her face , her arms and legs were tied down by rope. The artist announced his performance by saying \"here I will show you just how cruel the human mind can be! \" he then pulled out a projector and showed films of all sorts of war footage and riots, then after the slideshow was over he then said \"Now to show you human cruelty first hand!\" he then looked at the woman, stared at her for quite a while, his expression gaining a more angered and soured look , his fists clenched and tightened and he then proceeded to sock the woman in the face, must have broken her nose or something because the punch made a loud crunching sound , the womans face now bruised , swollen and bloody, he then got a lemon and squeezed it near the womans eyes , she was blinking rapidly and squinting, her eyes obviously irratated by the juice, then he cut one of the ropes loose , he walked over to the table and picked up a cheese grater , snatching the womans arm in a quick motion , he then turned to the audience , he had a horrifically sinister smile on his face , his teeth showing , his eyes had a threatening gaze , he kept that exact expression in that same position looking directly at the audience as he started shredding the womans elbow with the cheese grater , her eyes bloodshot , her gut wrenching screams echoing in the museum , a symphony of agony , I couldn't believe what I was looking at , I couldn't make a sound , my face frozen in horror, I looked at the rest of the guests in the audience , everyone was just as revolted and horrified as I was , some were looking away , some holding back vomit , some were straight up panicking , I was thinking to myself \"how is this allowed? , shouldn't the police be involved?\", to add literal insult to injury the artist dumped an entire shaker of salt onto the womans flayed , shredded elbow causing her to scream even louder , now her bruised face was bright red and sweaty, she eventually passed out from the pain but she was still alive , the artist responded to this by saying \"and to be even more cruel I will keep her alive\" he then called an ambulance to take the woman away, he then bowed to the audience and allowed eveyrone to leave. After seeing that I hoped he was arrested but I guess the artist got the meaning across pretty well... humans can be extremely cruel.",

      "content": "My Name is John Sims—and This is My Story My brother has been missing for over a month now. Nobody knows where he went, and something about the way he vanished from our parents’ house never sat right with me. It wasn’t like him to just disappear without a word. One night, curiosity got the better of me. While my parents were asleep, I crept into his room. It hadn’t been touched since he left—still exactly how he’d left it, like a shrine sealed in time. I began searching through his drawers, his closet, anything that might give me a clue. Then I heard a voice. “Look under the bed.” I froze. The voice was calm but unfamiliar. I don’t hear voices. I don’t have hallucinations. But something about it felt… real. Compelled, I knelt down and peered under his bed. There, covered in dust, was a black leather-bound book. His diary. It had a digital lock on it. For a second, I thought I was stuck—until I flipped the diary over. Scrawled in fading red ink on the back was a number: 1998. His birth year. I entered it. Click. The lock snapped open—and suddenly, a puff of fine black powder burst from between the pages, like inked smoke. I coughed uncontrollably, my lungs burning. Footsteps thundered from the hallway. “John! What are you doing in your brother’s room?” my dad shouted. “I’m—just looking for something!” I yelled back, scrambling to hide the book. Thankfully, they didn’t come in. I slipped the diary under my shirt and ran back to my own room, my heart pounding. Once I caught my breath, I opened it to the first page. March 11, 2016 I’m sick of this. Every single day at college, I’m bullied. They call me slurs, treat me like garbage. Ever since that prick spray-painted me with black paint, I’ve been a target. He found my locker key and trashed everything. I know it was him—he brags about it like he’s some kind of gangster. The entry went on, each word steeped in pain and rage. But what really caught my attention was what was written in the margin, almost like a hidden note. “BANKWEST ROAD QUARRY.” The quarry? That was just a few blocks from my house. My pulse quickened. Had he gone there? Was he hiding? Or…? I didn’t think—I just went. I grabbed my bike and pedaled fast, cutting through the night air like a knife. The town was asleep, and the moon glared down like a watchful eye. I reached the quarry and ditched my bike behind some bushes. The entrance was steep, overgrown with weeds and jagged rocks. I started down the hill—but my foot slipped on loose gravel. I tumbled. The world spun. My head cracked against something hard, and everything went black. When I came to, I was cold. My arms were numb. I tried to move—but I couldn’t. My wrists were bound. I was in a cage. The stench hit me next—rot, blood, and something sour, like decay. In the corner of the cage sat a figure. A corpse. No… not just any corpse. My brother. He was slumped over, his skin gray and peeling, eyes hollow. His mouth was twisted in a permanent scream. I stumbled backward, trying not to vomit. “What the f—” That’s when I heard the whispers. A group of people emerged from the shadows—figures in dark robes and masks, their faces hidden behind twisted smiles painted in white. One of them stepped forward. His mask was different—horns curled from the top like a demon’s crown. “You shouldn’t have read the book, John,” he said. Before I could scream, everything went dark again. ⸻ I don’t know if anyone will ever read this. But if you find this diary, burn it. And whatever you do, don’t go to the quarry.",

      "content": "I walked down a road for two hours before I realized that everything surrounding me was nothing but an illusion. Cloaked in a thick fog and yet overheating, the winding path burnt the flesh of my feet until I was marked by a trail of bloody folds of skin and echoing needles inside my exposed flesh. For a while I contemplated what to do before I had realized the futility and error of my ways in the first place, a sense of regret would have been filled to the brim within me, yet there was none left to give. So in the forced dream of an amber field planted and filled with the shit of fucking dogs in the summer heat. Another two years of walking brought me over a path of steel, the rage of implanted hands and nails grasped and pulled my face for fear of their own anger, and in the darkness they had no serenity. Sleeping under trees was a stained aryan slug that spewed vomit in its wake, for it had taken my place. And it laughed, spreading its hands to its diluted brethren who smiled because they had raped their son. They ate their diluted humor and pulled off their diluted flesh because they walked in patterns of zeroes, laboring for none under trees attended by foolish and gay foreigners who dug the graves in the skins of those who worked. Encased in hovels of vomit were men who found their pleasure in an ignorance of that which lay around them. They had known no pasin, and so caused. With no true empathy faked upon their friends, they did not care for those they had hung from meathooks in the ceiling, they did mutilate their genitals and they did fuck like bees in the heat as they sprad viuruses corrupting thier very bodies as they ate of those did embrace in their circles agtainst the pagan gods which did not bind them, because they belived in one bing. In the end, I came to rest in place i could no longer hold as it crumbled, yet in this place of serenity, I had found the skins, beautiful and pink and black and red and I did eat them for sustenance as I grew fat and delighted with myself, as I became them, I became them again and again and i had become the skin and in the skin I had become.",

      "title": "The Unnamed Tower",
      "content": "There is a land of oppressive nothingness. One I have come to know in my brief stint of life. One where obelisks of the darkest obsidian are chained together and stand vigil above a crashing sepulchral sea of black brine. Atop the haphazard vine-wrapped Hythean Cliffs, a stoic, single burning umbral flame licks energetically, sloughing an enervating light against an otherwise void pockmarked by stars never before observed. It sits at the apex of the tallest tower; an honorific to a long dead or forgotten god, whose likeness has crumbled with the erosion of time. It flits and dances in a fog of perpetual gray, overlooking the anger of the waves stories and stories and stories below. The tower, whose name has also been forgotten, is a gravesite and a memory. Its tall flanks, with deep purple-hued, naturally formed surfaces infinitely reflective of their observer, completely encase the thinner ascent of the tower. This thin rise terminates in a belfry topped by a tiled roof any onlooker would call gothic, with a serpentining rod one can only assume grounds lightning from the roiling thunderheads weeping above in perpetuity. Gargoyles stand at each compass rose position, their dead eyes and hardened husks forming nightmarish suggestions of opposition from sightlines beholden to the tower. I’ve visited the Hythean Cliffs but thrice in my years. I did not charter a ship, nor board a passenger plane. I could not convince any man-made vehicle to chart a course for these lands I’ve come to know as Kisaat. They could not be found upon a map, no atlas comprehends their anomalous geographic position. No, I instead awake in fields of gently whistling dead grass, I can see the minutiae of the tower, small only due to the sheer distance away the cliffs are from me. I stand completely stock-still in lamentation for sins I could not comprehend the gravity of— whether of my own feeble hands or of Man’s avarice I know not— yet here I stand in fields of what I perceive to be the furthest thing from Elysium when I fall aslumber. Above me, I am eyed by miles-high thunderclouds resembling anvil black cliffs teeming with the otherworldly discolored webs of lightning, filling me with trepidation and discouraging the curious nature commonplace of our ancestry. The air is dead, yet I taste the brack of salt upon my lips, feel the crunch of withered plantation beneath my feet as I walk, and hear the heaving chime of a bell most distant. I know this place— no, I have never been here, but I know of it. As if by some prescience of a miraculous caliber; a gift borne to me to be made aware of this terror at birth. I am alone here, a pariah to my waking life, but follow some lingering presence, baleful as it is. I am ensorceled by that tower, ominous and glowering with a flickering umbra set some miles upon the horizon. That horizon where the sepulchral sea churns and sprays water whose depths are pockmarked by the very cosmos. Mud writhes and grasps at each footfall I imprint— I am bare foot, my feet clammy and iced by a chill not beholden to my mind yet, for I am too enchanted, too horrified to allow myself the courtesy of awareness. I have walked for minutes, miles and eons yet the Hythean Cliffs bid me no closer than when I awoke within this barren emptiness that afears me so. I continue, slack-jawed and ignorant, afraid yet unresolved to halt my tread to reconsider my mortality. If I were to stop, it would know. It would be made aware of the betrayal I premeditated. Something within me, perhaps of the same mysticism that made my dumb mind aware of this otherworld and that damnable tower, screamed that if I were to stop, it would be annihilation. So I march, and I march. I continue across this eroding, muddy soil until my soles are raw and red. My skin hugs the bones that presume to hide underneath my being, my clothes long having decayed from the passage of time. I am alone here, but feel it strongly within my fading vitality that I chase some phantom presence imprinted upon this land bereft of eyes to watch upon my penance. For all the ages that pass, there is no change in the sky that judges me, ever silent. The miles-tall thunderclouds resembling anvil black cliffs continue their spontaneous eruptions of light that cracks the absent sky, and that tower is... closer. Damn the screaming thrum hammering my mind. I stop. I would take annihilation over the pitiable sentiment made immediately clear to my small brain. I watch that obelisk, flanked by so many smaller standing in silent vigil. I see the flame dappled against the presumption of a sky dotted with a forlorn starscape. My heart beats with a defiance— albeit small— against my breast. I won’t take one more step toward the tower flanked by infinite reflections. I shudder and feel my body sundered in the storm. I heave against the malefesance crashing into my frail form. For I know who is buried within. And I accept that I will never again wake.",

      "content": "Josh never came back. They found his backpack in the science wing, just outside the locked maintenance hallway. But not him. The school said he ran away—his parents weren’t convinced. Neither was I. Because two nights after he vanished, I got a text. From Josh’s number. It said: “She’s watching you.” I dropped my phone. When I picked it up, the message was gone. No trace of it. No history. It was like it never existed. But I knew what it meant. The girl from the Offline Room. The one with the white eyes and a smile too wide for her face. She hadn’t forgotten me. I started seeing her. In reflections. Windows. Black screens. Her face, just hovering there, eyes milky, smiling—watching. Sometimes she’d tilt her head like she was listening to something behind the glass. Other times, she mouthed words I couldn’t hear. The same phrase. Over and over. “Let me in.” I stopped sleeping. Every time I closed my eyes, I dreamed of corridors made of static, of wires wrapping around my limbs, of that room breathing like it was alive. And in every dream—Josh was there. Except… he wasn’t Josh anymore. His skin was pale. Veins black like ink. His mouth stitched shut, but the corners still curled into a smile. Standing behind him—her. She whispered in his ear. And he listened. I knew what I had to do. I waited until after school, snuck back to the science wing, and brought bolt cutters this time. The door was there again. Metal. Cold. Same eye-symbol on the handle—but now it was blinking. Yes. Blinking. I cut the lock. The door groaned open like it didn’t want to. The room was darker than before. The blackness moved, pulsing like something alive was trapped behind it. I stepped inside and instantly, all signals cut out. Phone dead. Flashlight off. The hum of the world vanished. Silence. Except for breathing. I didn’t run this time. I followed it. Down a hall I’d never seen. Past walls covered in handprints—bloody and frantic. A classroom door creaked open. Inside, desks floated in the air like they were suspended in water. At the front of the room, writing scrawled itself onto the blackboard. “You brought him back.” Josh stepped out of the corner. Or what was left of him. His jaw hung too low, like it was unhinged. Wires dangled from his fingers like puppet strings. His voice was not his own. “One out… one in.” Then I felt the cold breath on my neck. She was behind me. I turned— And everything went white. ⸻ I woke up in my bed. Clothes soaked in sweat. But something was different. My phone wouldn’t turn on. My watch blinked: NO SIGNAL And when I looked in the mirror… she smiled back.",

      "content": "There’s a room in my school that doesn’t show up on any map. It doesn’t have a room number. The janitors don’t clean it, the teachers pretend it’s not there, and most students don’t even notice it. But I did. I first found it when I was skipping class. I turned a corner near the old science wing—where no one ever goes anymore—and saw a door I’d never noticed. It was metal. Plain. No windows. But there was a strange symbol carved into the handle—like an eye with wires running from it. I pushed the door open. No lights. No sound. Just darkness that felt…thick, like it was trying to press into my skin. I stepped inside. The door closed softly behind me. That’s when I realized something was wrong. I pulled out my phone for a flashlight, but it didn’t work. Dead. Not even a flicker. I checked my watch—blank. My earbuds buzzed with static before going silent. No signal. Nothing worked. It was like the room was offline. I turned back to the door, but it was gone. I swear, I only took a few steps in, but now it was just an endless wall behind me. I shouted. My voice didn’t echo—it just got swallowed. That’s when I heard the breathing. Not mine. It was slow. Wet. Gurgling like something drowning in tar. I froze. Something moved in the corner of the room, but I couldn’t see it. I could only feel it—too many legs. Clicking, tapping against the floor. I ran. The space kept shifting. Hallways formed and collapsed. Doors led to closets that led to stairwells that spiraled endlessly. I scratched an arrow into the wall with a coin, but when I passed it again five minutes later, it was upside down. Time didn’t exist in there. Eventually, I found another person. A girl. Pale. Wearing our school uniform. I thought I was saved until I got closer. Her eyes were completely white. She didn’t blink. Just stared at me and smiled. Her mouth stretched too far—her cheeks cracking at the corners. Then she said, “You shouldn’t be in the offline room.” I turned to run, but she was suddenly in front of me again. And again. And again. No matter where I turned, her face was waiting, smiling wider each time. Then I blinked—and she was gone. I don’t remember finding the exit. I just woke up on the floor of the science wing. It was daytime. My phone buzzed with texts and missed calls. But when I looked back down the hall… The door was gone. No one believed me. Not my friends. Not the teachers. But last week, someone else disappeared. Josh from third period. I saw him walking toward the old wing. He hasn’t come back. They say it’s just rumors. An urban legend. But I know the truth. The offline room is still there. Waiting for a signal. ⸻",

      "content": "Title : Akraotrees OR Akroatírio tis sarkikís zoís Imagine this: every single human being has an invisible, extra terrestrial spectator connected to their mind from the moment they're born. These entities are called Akroatrees. There are as many Akroatrees as there are humans—8 billion of them right now. Each Akroatrees is born at the exact same time as their human counterpart, and the consciousness connects at that exact moment Akraotrees exist solely to watch that person’s life unfold. Think of it like each of us being the main character in a personal reality show… but the only audience member is an unknown entity, silently watching, judging, and hoping to be entertained. But here’s the twist: each Akroatrees has its own taste. One might love watching someone go through heartbreak after heartbreak. Another might be fascinated by a slow, uneventful life. Some might crave joy and constant success, while others are drawn to pure chaos. Space and time themselves exist, in part, to keep the Akroatrees entertained. Reality tends to manipulate circumstances in a person’s life to make it more entertaining for the Akroatrees connected to them. For example, if an Akroatrees enjoys a life of happiness and success, Reality may cause coincidences and events that lead that person toward joy and achievement. But Reality isn't perfect. It can't keep every Akroatrees entertained forever. And when an Akroatrees gets bored, truly bored, it doesn’t just switch channels. It ends the show. The human dies—sometimes in a quiet way, sometimes suddenly—and the Akroatrees dies too. In human world Reality manipulates the environment to end the show, that is the death of that person. That’s the rule: if the watcher gets bored, the watched one dies. It is a horrifying fact that Akraotrees cannot be kept entertained forever. Akroatrees cannot be kept entertained forever. Over time, they gradually lose interest in their human's life. Most Akroatrees get bored around the 80-year mark, though this varies. Some are impatient and might lose interest within minutes or hours—this may explain infant mortality. On rare occasions, Reality manages to keep an Akroatrees engaged for a full century, but even then, boredom eventually wins. Interestingly, one Akroatrees’s interests may occasionally overlap with others, leading to cross-entertainment. There’s a rumor, though. It’s said that once, Reality made a mistake. It connected a new born human’s mind the other way around—so instead of the Akroatrees watching the human, the human saw the Akroatrees. For 11 years, that person saw its life, understood its world, and somehow lived a normal life at the same time. When Reality fixed the error, the damage was done. That person remembered enough to spread the truth. No one knows where the Akroatrees live, why they exist, or whether this phenomenon applies only to humans—or to all intelligent life. What we do know is: we’re being watched. And if your life ever feels too boring… maybe your Akroatrees is already getting restless. The image above is rumored to be a Sketch found related to an Akroatrees years ago in a Greek kid's notebook, not sure what it means, assumed that it describes Akraotrees's body feature, not sure what body part that is or whether it's the whole body. No evidence of it being real. The kid whose notebook it was is also unaware of it. So if you ever wished to be an immortal, just wish that the Akraotrees you are connected with never gets bore.

      "content": "While this IS a creepy pasta. It did, by all accounts happen to us. So names have been changed. It was supposed to be just another lazy afternoon. The sky was heavy, gray, overcast — like the sun didn’t feel like showing up that day. Around noon, it was me — Mark — along with my nephew Derek, my cousin James, and our friend Paul. We figured we’d head into Elton Rogers Woodland Park, nothing serious. Just a walk to kill some time. But something was off. We hadn’t been walking long when it hit us — silence. Not the peaceful kind. The kind that fills your ears with pressure, like you're underwater. No birds, no wind, not even the faint scurry of animals. It was dead quiet. James picked up on it first. Said it didn’t feel right. He was uneasy, and honestly, I was starting to feel it too. The deeper we went, the weirder it got. This park isn’t big. You should be able to walk through it in twenty minutes, maybe thirty if you take your time. But we kept going for over an hour, and we still hadn’t seen the edge. It didn’t make sense. We passed signs of old hobo camps, abandoned. Left in a hurry, it seemed. Then we saw it — a dusty, unlabeled VHS tape lying in the dirt. No clue what was on it, just sitting there, like it was waiting. We didn’t touch it. Just looked at each other and silently agreed — it was time to turn back. Thing is… turning back didn’t feel right either. The trail, the trees — it was like everything had shifted slightly. Subtle, but enough to make your skin crawl. Paul and I started whistling, just to break the silence. I started in on some old western tune, nothing special. And then something whistled back. Not an echo. Not a bird. It mimicked me. Exactly. We sped up. We weren’t running yet, but we were on edge. It felt like we weren’t making any progress, like the park was somehow stretching. And then we heard it — shuffling. Not leaves under our own feet. Something else. Close. Derek pointed behind us. Said something moved. That’s when we all saw it. A figure. Tall. Dressed in what looked like a long-haired fur coat with a hood pulled up. Pale, lanky hands hung low at its sides. Face covered by a smooth, blank mask — no features, no expression. Its feet weren’t visible under the coat. It didn’t walk like a person. It stalked. The temperature dropped. We could see our breath. We ran. Branches clawed at us as we pushed through the undergrowth. At one point, Derek got caught in a thicket of bramble — thorns wrapped around his clothes. I grabbed him, tore him free, and we kept moving. No one looked back. Then, just like that, we burst out onto the road. Asphalt under our feet. Just a quarter mile from where I’d parked. And that’s when the sky opened up. The rain started pouring, heavy and cold, as if it had been holding off just until we got out. We didn’t stop. Ran to the car, piled in, slammed the doors shut, and left. We didn’t look back. We never watched that tape. And none of us have gone back to ER Park since, nor do we plan on going back. Any secrets it holds, it can keep.",

      "content": "My Name is John Sims—and This is My Story My brother has been missing for over a month now. Nobody knows where he went, and something about the way he vanished from our parents’ house never sat right with me. It wasn’t like him to just disappear without a word. One night, curiosity got the better of me. While my parents were asleep, I crept into his room. It hadn’t been touched since he left—still exactly how he’d left it, like a shrine sealed in time. I began searching through his drawers, his closet, anything that might give me a clue. Then I heard a voice. “Look under the bed.” I froze. The voice was calm but unfamiliar. I don’t hear voices. I don’t have hallucinations. But something about it felt… real. Compelled, I knelt down and peered under his bed. There, covered in dust, was a black leather-bound book. His diary. It had a digital lock on it. For a second, I thought I was stuck—until I flipped the diary over. Scrawled in fading red ink on the back was a number: 1998. His birth year. I entered it. Click. The lock snapped open—and suddenly, a puff of fine black powder burst from between the pages, like inked smoke. I coughed uncontrollably, my lungs burning. Footsteps thundered from the hallway. “John! What are you doing in your brother’s room?” my dad shouted. “I’m—just looking for something!” I yelled back, scrambling to hide the book. Thankfully, they didn’t come in. I slipped the diary under my shirt and ran back to my own room, my heart pounding. Once I caught my breath, I opened it to the first page. March 11, 2016 I’m sick of this. Every single day at college, I’m bullied. They call me slurs, treat me like garbage. Ever since that prick spray-painted me with black paint, I’ve been a target. He found my locker key and trashed everything. I know it was him—he brags about it like he’s some kind of gangster. The entry went on, each word steeped in pain and rage. But what really caught my attention was what was written in the margin, almost like a hidden note. “BANKWEST ROAD QUARRY.” The quarry? That was just a few blocks from my house. My pulse quickened. Had he gone there? Was he hiding? Or…? I didn’t think—I just went. I grabbed my bike and pedaled fast, cutting through the night air like a knife. The town was asleep, and the moon glared down like a watchful eye. I reached the quarry and ditched my bike behind some bushes. The entrance was steep, overgrown with weeds and jagged rocks. I started down the hill—but my foot slipped on loose gravel. I tumbled. The world spun. My head cracked against something hard, and everything went black. When I came to, I was cold. My arms were numb. I tried to move—but I couldn’t. My wrists were bound. I was in a cage. The stench hit me next—rot, blood, and something sour, like decay. In the corner of the cage sat a figure. A corpse. No… not just any corpse. My brother. He was slumped over, his skin gray and peeling, eyes hollow. His mouth was twisted in a permanent scream. I stumbled backward, trying not to vomit. “What the f—” That’s when I heard the whispers. A group of people emerged from the shadows—figures in dark robes and masks, their faces hidden behind twisted smiles painted in white. One of them stepped forward. His mask was different—horns curled from the top like a demon’s crown. “You shouldn’t have read the book, John,” he said. Before I could scream, everything went dark again. ⸻ I don’t know if anyone will ever read this. But if you find this diary, burn it. And whatever you do, don’t go to the quarry. Thanks for reading this!",

      "content": "I am plucking out hair on a hairy man's body, one by one. The reason I am doing this is because whenever I pluck out hair one by one, I get a different reaction everytime. I take away from hairy bodies and people come to me to be less hairy. As I am plucking out hair on this man's body, when I plucked out one single hair, he gave the reaction that he was being stabbed. Then I plucked out another single hair and he gave out the reaction that he was in relief. Then when I plucked out another single hair on its own, he looked angry and he said fuck off to me like he was going into a fight. This was unusual and when I kept on plucking out single hair on his chest, he started singing. Then his reaction to plucking out another single hair on his body was mourning. I mean usually people have the same reactions to plucking out hair one by one, and its usually discomfort and pain. This guy would give different reactions to each single hair being pulled out of his body. Sometimes he will act like a business man, other times he will act like a homeless man and sometimes he will act like he is a psychopath. My orders were to pluck out each hair one by one and to record each reaction. Then others things started to happen and when I plucked out each hair from his body, not only will his voice and personality change but rather his body changed with it. If he started talking like a body builder then his body also became muscular. If he started talking like a vegan activist, he became extremely skinny. When I plucked out one hair from his body, he started talking like a wounded soldier and he suddenly changed into a wonded soldier. One of his arms fell off and scars started to appear. Then I managed to pluck out another single hair and he started talking like a rich prince. Then his arm grew back and he was so posh now. At one point he started to talk like a cancer stricken patient and before all the hairs fell out of his body, I managed to pluck out one and he changed into a fisherman. I wondered what would happen if I plucked out a bunch of hair all at the same time. I mean I was not allowed to pluck a bunch of hairs all at the same time, but I wanted to see what his reaction would be. So I grabbed a load of his chest and plucked them out. He started speaking in multiple voices and his body changed to look like multiple bodies. I was seriously regretting it now and then multiple people came out of him. I just ran out and locked the room.",

I remember when kabils son was playing around in some muddy like substance, and then we all realised that he was actually playing around in some creatures decomposing body. Everyone was concerned but I was so over joyed to see happiness in something so putrid and disgusting. Kabils son was too stupid too realise what was happening. Kabils son was playing around in some decomposing creatures body, and we could see the bones of all the victims that it ate. Then kabils son was grabbed and washed and he wasn't traumatised at all. I like to think that Kabils son isn't stupid but rather it will be hard for him to be traumatised, it will be hard for him to recollect things and it will be hard for him to hate. Kabils son is blessed in my eyes and everyone else looks at kabils son like he is a curse among the community. When kabils son was kidnapped he wasn't crying or scared but rather he was happy because he thought it was a day trip. We pulled him out of the cupboard as a creature was trying to kidnap him through the cupboard. Everyone was terrified but kabils son was laughing and not knowing what had just happened to me. I thought it was amazing at seeing kabils son resilience to something so terrible. Kabils son simply went forward living his life and doing what he wanted to do, he didn't have any ptsd of any kind. His survival in life is amazing and with his level of stupidity, he is doing really well. Then the time has come when the sun is about to blow up now and every human got on a ship to leave earth. Everyone was sad except for kabils son, he was smiling and joyous. Every human was on a ship and within a safe distance, every human was going to witness the sun blowing up and engulfing the earth. Everyone was crying except for kabils son. Then when it came for the sun to blow up, the sun didn't blow up. Everyone was surprised and then an hour went by and the sun hadn't blown up. Everyone questioned the science and our knowledge. Everyone went back to earth and they were cheerful and they thought we had the science wrong. The science wasn't wrong but simply, I had built a machine to keep the sun from blowing for only a whole day. Then when my machine couldn't hold it, the sun blew up and it took the whole earth and it had killed everyone. I'm sure everyone was terrified apart from kabils son. What a blessing the stupidity must be for kabils son's.",

      "content": "It started with my laptop freezing. Normal stuff I figured it was a memory issue or a background update. I restarted it, and when it booted back up, a new folder was sitting in the middle of my desktop. No name. Just a blank white icon. I tried to delete it. No luck. “File in use.” I opened it. Inside were dozens of videos. All titled with timestamps—dates and times, going back years. All exactly 3 minutes and 33 seconds long. Some dated before I even owned this laptop. I clicked on the oldest one. It was grainy, black and white, like it had been filmed through an old security camera. The footage showed a dimly lit room. Empty. No windows. Just a single chair in the center. About 20 seconds in, someone walked into frame. It was me. Same haircut. Same hoodie I was literally wearing. I sat in the chair. Stared directly into the camera. Never blinked. Never moved. Just stared for three straight minutes until the video ended. I felt sick. I checked the timestamp. That date I was in the hospital because of a car accident. I had been unconscious for three days. The next video? Me again. This time I was older. And the room had changed—scratches on the walls, something written in a language I couldn’t read. Again, I just sat. Stared. Unmoving. I watched ten of these videos. Each time, it was me. In that room. Looking more exhausted. More... hollow. The last video was dated tomorrow. I shouldn’t have watched it. It starts like the others. I walk into the room, dragging my feet like I haven’t slept in weeks. But this time, I’m shaking. My eyes are wide, terrified. I look behind me. I whisper something but there’s no audio. Then, something steps into the room. I paused it. It wasn’t human. It had too many joints. Its limbs bent the wrong way. No face. I could only see its outline because the moment it entered, the footage began to distort. I forced myself to finish the video. My copy of me tries to scream. It doesn’t work. The thing touches my shoulder, and the screen goes black. That’s it. That’s the end of the folder. Except now, there’s one more video. No timestamp. Just a live feed. The camera is in my room. And I can see myself, right now, sitting at my desk. And behind me? The feed just flickered...",

      "title": "I Saw Myselfs on the CCTV, and the Mall Became a Maze of Mes [Part 1]",
      "content": "I’ve been working security at a dying mall for three years. It’s a place stuck in time—flickering lights, creaky floors, and empty corridors. But last night? Last night, though, the mall showed me something I can’t unsee. Now I’m scared to close my eyes, let alone go back, for should my head start spinning again, I might go mad. It was 2 a.m., the hour when the world feels like it’s holding its breath. The security office was a coffin of buzzing fluorescents and cracked plastic chairs, the monitors casting a sickly glow across my thermos of cold coffee. I was half-asleep, lulled by the static hum from my radio, when Camera 7—the food court feed—flickered. There I was, walking past the shuttered pretzel kiosk. My navy uniform hung loose on my frame, my slouch unmistakable. But I was here, in the office, not there. The timestamp pulsed: 2:03 a.m., now, alive. My stomach churned, a violent swirl like gears grinding an old maschine. I grabbed my radio, my voice trembling. “Anyone in the building? Identify yourself!” Only static answered, threaded with a faint whine, like wind through a cracked window. The log showed no one signed in. I was alone. But the mall seemed to disagree. On the screen, the figure that wore my face froze. He turned, slow as a marionette, and stared into the camera. His eyes were too large, pupils blooming like ink spilled in milk, and his mouth stretched into a smile that wasn’t mine. The smile stretched too far—unnaturally wide, like invisible hands were pulling his face from both sides. The air in the office thickened, tasting of copper and ozone. He raised a hand, fingers elongating, curling like tendrils, and pointed, not at the camera, but through it—into me. The monitor hissed, and his face pressed against the lens, skin rippling like a pond disturbed by a stone. Then the feed dissolved - into a kaleidoscope of static, colors bleeding into shapes that made my temples throb. I knocked over my coffee, the liquid pooling on the floor in patterns that looked like spiraling galaxies. My breath caught in shallow gasps, each one jagged, as if the air itself had grown thicker as I cycled through the other cameras. Camera 12 - east entrance: another me, standing before the glass doors, head tilted so far it touched his shoulder, his shadow stretching across the floor, writhing like a nest of eels. Camera 4 - the atrium: me, perched on a bench, rocking back and forth, my hands melted into my knees, fingers sinking into the flesh as though I were made of wax, softening under pressure. Camera 9- service corridor: me, pacing in a spiral, my footsteps leaving smears of light that pulsed and faded. Each feed showed a new me, each more wrong. One crawled across the electronics store’s floor, limbs bending backward, joints popping like wet wood. Another stood in the fountain, water cascading upward, defying gravity, his reflection a fractured mosaic of eyes and mouths. The timestamps flickered, numbers dissolving into glyphs—squirming like worms, writhing as though alive. The monitors hummed a low, discordant song, and the walls of the office seemed to pulse, veins of light threading through the plaster. I tried my phone -dead. The radio spat static, now laced with voices, overlapping, all mine, whispering words I couldn’t grasp. The air grew heavy, pressing against my skin like damp velvet. Then the office door groaned, bending inward as if underwater. I spun around, flashlight beam slicing the dark, but the doorway was a void, swallowing light. The monitors flickered in unison, and every feed showed me, standing in the office, staring at the screens. Behind each me loomed a shadow, taller than the room allowed, its edges fraying into tendrils that coiled around the walls, the ceiling, the air itself. The shadows didn’t move, but their presence burned in my mind, a weight that made my thoughts slippery. The shadows stretched towards me, and I realized, with a sickening lurch, that they had already started to crawl inside my mind.",

      "content": "I live in a cheap , sort of run down looking apartment complex , nothing really too special or intersting the whole place is rather bland and boring ,but one day I noticed the door across from my room \"room 13\" by itself it didn't seem intersting but the thing that made me wonder was the fact I've never seen anyone enter, leave or even interact with that room , not even the landlord which was unusual because they would check every room for rent or complaints or something like that but no , no one ever really interacted with that room , and oddly enough it was the most quiet room in the entire building no thuds , bangs , voices , running , laughter , TV running anything just dead silent, so I decided to open the door myself , assuming no one was in there, and when I opened it... what I saw horrified me , the room had barely anything in it other than a bed and a dresser but that wasn't what scared me obviously what filled me with dread was what was ON the bed , a giant puddle of thick blood almost looking like maple syrup with how thick it looked, the bed was stained but the blood was slowly floating upwards onto the ceiling , despite it staining the bed it wasn't doing that to the ceiling, the the viscous, sticky blood was phasing through the wall, while it was doing this I finally heard a noise from the room , loud reversed crying , almost like a ghost pleading for help. In a panic I shut the door, when I did the noise stopped completely , I looked around to see if anyone heard or saw what I did , but no one had their door open , no one saw it , not even some angry guy complaining about the noise , as if it didn't happen. I thought to myself \"maybe I was just making stuff up\" and fearfully I opened the door again to find that the blood and screams were gone but now another horror occupied the vaccant room , a tall hunched over clown , his head bigger than the rest of his body , at first the thing was faced away from me but then its head jolted up , and it slowly turned to me , and its face... oh god... its face... it didn't have any eyes just giant black hole like sockets, almost like someone got a cookie cutter and stuck it in the clowns face, its mouth was a giant , gaping toothless grin, and multiple bright , candy colored beetles and roaches crawled out of the clowns toothless grin , it raised its cartoonishly gloved hand and let out a high pitched laugh and then a lower pitched \"NOOOOOOO\" sound , once again shut the door in terror , and each time I opened it a new terror awaited , a doll shivering and shuttering its head in a fast paced motion , something that looked like an oversized crab with a grinning human face , a cat with bloodshot human eyes and a gaping screaming hole for a mouth , a giant centpede with a crocodile head moving after me in a slow motion fashion and at one point the room wasn't even a room anymore just a black void with various glowing ghostly faces floating from the bottom to the top. I rushed to the landlord and asked them if the door even truly existed and low and behold it WAS a real room, it wasn't just my imagination , I tried to get them to open the door but they said \"you're just wasting my time!\" and now I'm left here sleepless wondering if what I saw was real or not but now I know... Nightmares wait just across from me at all times.",

      "content": "I didn’t forward it. Not because I couldn’t. But because… part of me wanted to know how far this went. What it really was. I smashed the recorder. I took it outside behind the motel, found a chunk of concrete, and pounded it until plastic and wires scattered like dead bugs. Then I dumped the pieces in a dumpster and drove until the motel disappeared behind me. But I should’ve known better. You don’t kill something like that. You just make it mad. That night, I stopped at a gas station off the highway. I went in to grab coffee, try to feel human again. When I came back out… The recorder was sitting in my passenger seat. Fully intact. One new file. REC007.wav This one had no sound. Just silence. Ten minutes of pure, deafening nothing. But then, at the very end, a single word: “Soon.” I threw it out the window while driving 80 miles an hour. I didn’t care where it landed. But the next morning, it was in my motel drawer. Waiting. Its red light blinking like it had been watching me sleep. That’s when I realized it didn’t need the recorder anymore. It had me. I was the vessel now. That night, I dreamt in audio files. Not memories—recordings. People screaming. Pleading. And whispering my name. They weren’t just trapped in the recorder. They were collecting. Then I heard a new voice—faint, but unmistakably mine—saying: “If you find this, I’m already gone.”",

      "content": "Apparently online I have a network of 1 billion pounds? And basically it was my stalker who told me when they were looking me up online, and they started poking themselves on their tummy with a pin needle. They then saw that it said that I had a net worth of 1 billions pounds. Then my stalker became desperate for money and they came to me, and they were honest with me about stalking and poking their belly with a needle while searching for me online. I was shocked that it said that I had a networth of a billions pounds online, I was definitely not rich. Then when I went to my job working at the warehouse, I picked up a heavy box that said that it would take 5 people to carry. I picked it up in one. I couldn't stop going online and just seeing how it said that I was a billionaire. My stalker told other people and they too went online and searched me up. They saw that it had said that I had a networth of a billion pounds. People came to me with all sorts of problems and they were asking me for money. I kept trying to tell them that I wasn't rich and I had no saving at all. Still people kept coming to me for all sorts of problems and wanting me to give them money to solve. I kept trying to tell them that I had no money and that they should not believe whatever they see on the internet. People started to hate me and some were even jealous of me. Then one guy at work kept asking me to lift heavy boxes, some boxes required 50 people lift and a other one had required 100 people to lift. I managed to lift it on my own. The man was then scared and not because I could lift it on my own, but because if I can lift a package that requires more than 1 person, then that means I must have multiple people inside of me. So if I lifted a package that requires 100 people to lift, then that means I must have more than 100 people inside of me. Then when I lifted a package that required a thousand people to lift, I couldn't believe it. Then that answers why online it says that my networth is a billions pounds. I am a thousand people in one. Then as I joined the army for a better life, I decided to desert it as I hated it. Then a load of people started to come out of me because I deserted the army. Now I could only lift a package that requires 200 people. Also my networth online has been reduced.",

      "content": "The drive link will take you to what was originally sent to me by a friend of mine. We’ll call him Luke - because that’s his name. If you know where Luke Burchette went, please reply to the post. He’s been missing for several weeks. Before he disappeared, Luke invited me to play TTRPGs with a “table” that he “runs.” He’s the GM or DM or whatever it’s called. I’m not into the whole table top role play game thing. But, his mom passed away in the last three months. And you don’t say no to your best friend who’s mom passed away in the last three months. He’s been trying to get me to go for years but I always had an excuse other than “I don’t want to.” The night was…fine, I guess. I got to meet Zach and his girlfriend, Julie. I could tell she wasn’t into it much either, but maybe a lot more in comparison to me. Interest by proximity to Zach, maybe? I got “into character” as best I could. It was stupid, but it’s like they didn’t care as long as everyone was having fun. I still don’t get modifiers and spell slots and have no understanding of what’s going on in the story Luke is running in the campaign (I think that’s what he called it?), but luckily, I wasn’t called out, or made fun of, or anything like that, and everyone was really kind. I saw a side of Luke that I haven’t seen before. Maybe he’s coping or trying to distract himself. Or maybe it’s who he really is? He and his mom were close. I really couldn’t tell if he was “okay” or not I’m writing all this because Luke is a good person, and he’s still grieving, and I feel, weirdly, like it’s my fault he disappeared. I declined his invite to the next session they had after that night. I didn’t have any excuse that time. I just told him I didn’t want to. It’s messed up. The one time that it would have been honest and upfront, it was a lie. Luke - as cheerful and as into game night as he was - made me feel uncomfortable. And I hate myself for feeling that way. He said it was okay and we moved on. But what if it wasn’t? What if turning down his game night invite was the last tiny straw, that to him, wasn’t tiny at all? What if something so cosmically insignificant had the largest impact because of where Luke is….was…emotionally at the time? I don’t know if I’m reading into it too much, but when I said no to game night, it’s like every sense I had zoned in on his reaction. Was he angry? Upset? Sad? If any, he played it off really well. When he said “that’s too bad, but it’s okay, maybe we’ll see you at the next one” with a faint smile and forced “aw drat” gestures, was he just hiding what he really felt? Or worse, did he actually not care if I said yes or no, and just felt the need to invite me out of courtesy? Maybe he and Zach and Julie actually didn’t want me there and were hoping I’d say no. I’m afraid I’ll never know. This isn’t about me, I know, but I’m scared of how I’ve messed with my friendship by just being honest at the wrong time. This isn’t about me, and all I can think about is how this effects me, and I hate myself for it. It’s actually not the ONLY thing I think about. The PDF I linked at the top. It’s….weird. For so many reasons that I can’t list them all, but I’ll do my best. Zach and Julie’s names are listed as separate authors; one at the top, the other at the bottom. Luke sent it to me over email. At least, it came from HIS email address. The email was titled “eat the cake” but the pdf is titled “don’t eat the cake.” That’s odd, but not as odd as the email having no body to it. It was just a title and the attachment. I don’t know if it matters, but I got the email immediately, and I mean immediately after I gave him a call and he didn’t answer. He still hasn’t answered texts or calls. At least, my texts and calls anyway. I haven’t been able to get ahold of Zach or Julie either. I don’t use Facebook much, but I tried to find them, and it’s like they don’t exist. They have a kid together apparently. What couple their age doesn’t put a picture of them and their kid on Facebook? Zach’s name appears toward the end of the pdf too, typed in font that didn’t show up until a couple of pages beforehand. I feel really wigged out about it. I feel like it was Julie who typed it, but it sounded desperate and creepy. Too creepy to be some joke. Luke’s name doesn’t appear anywhere in the pdf, even though, again, he sent it to me. If this is some kind of practical joke, it isn’t funny, and gets even less funny with each day I can’t reach any of them. The pdf is the strangest and maybe creepiest thing I’ve ever read, in the context of what it appears to be and the current situation. It reads like a rule book to a game, but the format becomes a mess early on and spirals from there. That face. I can’t get that face out of my head. Please, if you’ve seen or know Luke Burchette, Zach Source, or Julie Boli, please let me know. It’s a shot in the dark, I know, but Luke is always on Reddit when I see him at his computer, so I have to try here.",

      "content": "Everyone wants to see what they are worthy of and so they go to lands of worthiness. On these lands are an assorted of many weapons all attached to the floor, walls and on anything hard. To pick them up you need to be worthy of something. When Gail tried to pick up a sharp pair of scissors off a wall, she couldnt take it off because she wasn't worthy. Only a truth teller was worthy to take the scissors off the wall. Gail was sad that she wasn't worthy of picking up the scissors and so she went somewhere else and try to pick up another weapon. She tried to lift the sword from the floor and she was sad that she couldn't pick up the sword from the floor. The reason Gail wasn't worthy of picking up the sword was because she was a coward. Gail felt offended that she wasn't worthy of picking up this sword. Then she tried to pluck put another sword from a stone, but she want worthy because she was ugly. She was really agitated by this because she wasn't worthy to pick up the sharp scissors and 2 swords. Gail couldn't believe it because when she looked at herself in the mirror, she saw an amazing human being. Then when Gail tried to pick up a shield from the floor, she was angry that she couldn't pick it up. She couldn't pick up this shield because she wasn't worthy, only someone who is empathetic towards other people were worthy of picking up this shield. Gail was angry now and when she tried to pick up a stick, she wasn't worthy of even picking up this stick. The only ones worthy of picking up this stick were ones that charitable, Gail couldn't believe that she wasn't worthy of picking up and lifting so many weapons. Then Gail felt like shit right now and then finally she wable to pick up a rock slinger and she was happy. Then she was able to pick up a sledge hammer and she couldn't believe her luck now. I guess sometimes it's just a matter of luck and time. Then all of a sudden she was able to pick up a knife and then the weapons told her why she was worthy of picking them up. She was worthy of picking up the rock slinger because she was an asshole, she was worthy of picking up a sledge hammer because she was a liar, and she was worthy of picking up a knife because she was a murderer. Then the people who take care of the lands of worthiness saw that she pick up the knife, that are only murderers are worthy of picking up. She put the knife on the ground and other people couldn't pick up the knife because they aren't murderers. Then Gail tried hitting them with the sledge hammer becaude she needed to be arrested, and the others contained her by using their weapons which they are worthy of.",

      "title": "I Was on Board MH370. And I’m Not Dead...",
      "content": "I know what the world believes. MH370—gone. Vanished over the sea. No wreckage. No survivors. No answers. But I was on that flight. And I’m still here. It was supposed to be a routine night flight. Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Nothing special. I was tired, irritable, just wanted to sleep. The man next to me had headphones on. The lights were low. A child was crying somewhere behind us. A flight attendant passed by, smiling kindly as she handed me water. There was something odd in her eyes. Like she knew something we didn’t. Around 1 a.m., the cabin settled. The engines hummed, steady and calming—almost like a heartbeat. Then, the lights flickered. Once. Twice. Three times. And then— silence. Not just inside the plane. Everywhere. It was as if someone had turned off the world. There was no turbulence. No warning. No sense of falling. Only stillness. And then a flash—blinding. A noise like static crashing through my skull. And then— darkness. I woke up, still in my seat. Strapped in. But I wasn’t on the plane anymore. I was in a forest. The ground was damp. Everything smelled like smoke and metal. Above me: trees. Massive. Alien. Around me: wreckage scattered in impossible ways. I stumbled, dizzy. My ears rang. Then I heard voices. I wasn’t alone. About twenty of us had survived—somehow. Bruised, bleeding, terrified. We banded together. Set up a makeshift camp. Tried to figure out where we were. But nothing made sense. No working phones. No signal. No compass that pointed anywhere consistent. And the forest… it wasn’t right. The leaves shimmered faintly, like plastic. The trees breathed. I swear to God, they breathed. On the third day, someone disappeared. A young man claimed he saw lights deeper in the trees. He followed them. We heard his footsteps fade into the distance. And then—nothing. We found his shoes. Perfectly placed side by side. Beside a strange circle of scorched earth. Others began sleepwalking. Muttering in languages they didn’t speak. One woman stared into the trees for hours, unblinking. As if something were whispering just beyond hearing. Then we found the stone. A massive black monolith in a clearing. Too smooth. Too clean. Covered in faint symbols—spirals, lines, circles. And at night—it pulsed. Blue light. Slow. Steady. Like a heartbeat. The days blurred together. Sometimes the sun would rise twice. Other times, not at all. Time meant nothing here. We tried to hold on. Tried to stay sane. But this place… it devours sanity. Not with teeth. With silence. With repetition. People started to vanish. One by one. Some ran into the woods. Some just… faded. I stopped asking why. Eventually, I was the only one left. Not all at once. It happened slowly—quietly. I wandered through the forest, hoping to find a road. A village. A sign. But the forest never ended. And sometimes… it moved. Trees weren’t where they had been the day before. The wind carried whispers—voices I knew were dead. And at night, reflections would appear in the bark. Like mirrors. But the reflection wasn’t mine. It smiled when I didn’t. It blinked when I stood still. Then—one gray, breathless morning—I found the sea. It was silent. Black. Motionless. No waves. No wind. No gulls. Just a still, endless surface. I climbed to the top of a cliff overlooking it. I don’t know why. Instinct, maybe. Or whatever this place lets you still have of instinct. And then—I heard it. A low hum. Far away. I looked up. And I saw it. A plane. Tiny. Circling slowly in the sky. Too high to be real. Like a shadow of a plane that once was. I screamed. Waved. Begged. But it never came closer. It didn’t see me. It couldn’t. It was like a memory. Or an echo. Or worse— a trap. I don’t know how long I’ve been here. I don’t even know what “here” is anymore. But I want someone to know. Someone needs to know. So I’ve carved this story into a piece of the wreckage—a chunk of metal from the wing. I’m going to throw it into the sea. Maybe it’ll float. Maybe the current will take it somewhere. Maybe you’re reading it now. And if you are— Don’t look for us. Don’t try to find the flight. Don’t try to explain what happened. This place wants to stay hidden. And it’s watching. If you ever fly across the South China Sea… and your lights flicker… and the engine noise fades… and you feel something just beyond your vision— Close your eyes. And pray you don’t hear the hum. Because if you do— you’re already here...",

      "content": "This isn't really a creepypasta per se since it's my own experience, but I thought it was relevant to share given the context. It is related certainly. Back around 2012-2014 I was absolutely obsessed with minecraft, both the game itself and the Fandom. Around this same time I was also super interested in creepypastas and anything internet horror/ urban legend related, so obviously these two interests would coincide with stuff like herobrine. I played minecraft primarily on the xbox 360 version with countless hours spent on a few worlds just doing general survival stuff, but sometimes when I'd want a little change of pace, I'd start a new world in creative mode and arm myself up with the best gear I could and build a little starter base. Stacks of golden apples for food, putting my favorite enchants on a full set of diamond armor and tools, so on. The point of it all was to be prepared for a little \"herobrine expedition\" where I'd basically go out in survival after arming myself and explore whatever wilderness was beyond my starting bunker to try and find him. None of these \"expeditions\" went on for an extreme length or anything, but i did finally find something one of those quiet post-school afternoons. This latest creative world was started in a jungle biome so that's the scenery I was looking at when exploring this time. In admist a bunch of those 2x2 tall jungle trees, vines and bushes, I rounded a few corners and saw something really really weird. It wasn't herobrine but it wasn't anything I can name. It was a player model like Steve basically and I know it wasn't a zombie since the arms were definitely down at its sides, not thin enough to be an enderman or skeleton either and also not a villager for the same reason as the zombie. Instead of something like a default model like herobrine, it was completely stark white like no texture on the model at all, and it was totally on fire. Like that same effect that goes over your player character when you jump in lava or other fire sources, swallowing the bright white model. It was just kinda standing there on top of one of those big bushes on the jungle floor. I only saw it for maybe 1 or 2 seconds before it vanished and I really can't think of an answer as to what it was. Its not like it was a mob dying in weird position considering it didn't leave any of the smoke particles or turn red when it dissapeared. I know this wasn't a dream or anything it's a very vivid memory of mine, sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit for it though. Here's an image mockup I made for reference:",

      "content": "Her name was Dorothy- my daughter, she had my eyes and my orange hair, she was such a happy little girl frolicking around with Zachariah our little white puff ball- who refuses to let me near Dorothy while around, such a protector. She readily pointed out how strange I was acting and gleefully showed how I normally did things. A single day of bliss, the park, dinner with the wife and mini golf. They must have relied on the other Ron to make every decision because we only went where I wanted to go. Looking through Ron's house began to paint a picture, our differences are so very staggering, the man is ex-military and decorated with a purple heart. This Ron seemed to have really embraced protecting the family from anything. So many medals and awards it really piqued my curiosity about just how much information must be on my phone. Sadly, trying to open my phone never came to fruition, Ron was oddly private with the password. Embracing Roseline, spending the day with her again, and to just eat dinner with them would have been enough, I could have gone back to my life happy knowing they were alive and safe even if out of my reach. It wasn't until after the meal that it began to sink in, my eyes weight seemed to be ever increasing, and my body refused to move no matter how hard I willed it to do so. Left with Rose's facade of a smile- a single kiss lay against my brow as sleep began to overtake my body, she spoke, A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will not go free. Then a whisper so faint a breadth of air could have drowned it out, Ron you won't be coming back. The adrenaline from the intense anger propelled my body forward, only after my feet hit the floor did the agony set in. Sprawled across the floor and bleeding, I began to take in what had happened, on the bloodstained bed, a set of bloody worn scissors. So many tendons have been sliced, only my left arm was untouched. Her words! While I was living it up over there, he was systematically crippling my body and any chances I had of ever getting back there. Painfully, I pulled myself through the living rooms black abyss attempting to make an escape, that's when I found the lamp placed in the center of the floor right in front of the door to the outside. Skittishly, I reached for the switch, as the light graced the bloody words written across the front door, any sense of happiness once felt left my body to be filled a burning desire for vengeance. Scrawled across the door- \"Zachariah is no more\" The deep dread and hatred I felt for the loss of Zachariah almost ended my life entirely. The Ronald I switched with went berserk and had to be sedated immediately; thank God my nurses were around. My trip was much less pleasurable. Zachariah looked so malnourished and had this rot coming from his breadth and that bark, it sounded just like a babies laughter. It took mere moments before I had to barricade myself in the bedroom. Zachariah had long since devoured the family and I was next on the menu. The floors had a layer of filth on them and the room seemed to be in a state of decay. Looking into the mirror revealed I was skin and bones with multiple sores across my body. At that moment, the sounds of Zachariah devouring the door ceased and a crash came from the front door. Only the tearing of flesh, inhumane screams and babies laughter greeted me through the door. Sudden fight or flight took over and I kicked the door open to run away and was met with the reverberations of a metallic pipe connecting with my skull. Losing consciousness, I only heard \"Daddy, you're acting so weird. My eyes shot open, only the left arm seemed to work again, and I felt so very groggy. I drifted back off as a smile formed across my face. 10 years of practice and perfecting what I deemed as feeling hopping, 10 long years and I am finally so close. Unable to move freely and in need of a constant caretaker taught me to explore the mind and read into Universal Theories. It never took any pain or suffering, my darling Zachariah was always the way. Picturing him and the deep sense of love while entering into a deep rem cycle creates a gateway to that ideal world. Any deep emotion related to him creates pathways. The thing is you always switch places with the world you hop into and the emotion related to the switch seems to involve the Ron on the other side. None of that's important though, I was not the only one trying to take that ideal world from Ronny boy. Less and less of my emotions allowed transfers, it seems eliminating the other Ron's that show up has been in the process since our meeting. My plan is set in motion, tomorrow I will initiate the trade and will come out on top, by any means necessary. Part 2",

      "content": "After that night, I knew I couldn’t stay in that apartment. I packed everything I could in one bag and left before sunrise. I didn’t even bother locking the door. I drove for hours. No destination—just away. Eventually, I stopped at a run-down motel on the edge of some town I didn’t even catch the name of. The kind of place where the receptionist doesn’t ask questions, and the vending machine still takes quarters. I couldn’t sleep. I pulled the recorder from my bag. New file. No title this time—just: REC005.wav But before I could hit play, something strange happened. It rang. Like a phone. It had no number. No contact list. No signal. But it rang—three sharp tones, like an old rotary landline. And then it answered itself. A voice came through. Calm. Collected. Almost bored. “You have it too, don’t you?” I didn’t respond. “Don’t worry. I’m not one of them. I’m… what’s left.” I finally spoke. “What are you talking about? One of what?” The voice sighed. “The ones trapped in the recordings. The ones who listened too long. They don’t die. They echo.” Static crackled. He continued. “There are more recorders. Dozens. Maybe hundreds. All passed around, sold, abandoned. Each one captures what shouldn’t be heard. And if you listen, it knows you. Follows you.” I asked, “How do I get rid of it?” There was silence. Then— “You don’t. You just delay it. Pass it on. Someone else has to choose to listen. That’s the only way.” The call cut off. I stared at the recorder. My hands trembled. Then it made another sound—a notification chime. Like a new message. REC006.wav This one had a label underneath: “Forward to Someone You Know.”",

Like she belonged in an ukiyo-e woodblock print, or a forgotten poem whispered by moonlight. I met her on a foggy evening at the foot of Mt. Osore, near a ruined shrine. I was there researching local legends for a book—yōkai, ghosts, old curses—and she claimed to be a folklore scholar, too. We connected instantly. She spoke in this soft voice, but her words always lingered a second too long in my mind, like incense smoke in a closed room. We married within two months. I know. Stupid. It was only after the wedding that things got... wrong. — THE SIGNS — Animals hated her. I had a dog, Tama, a loyal mutt who’d been with me for five years. The moment Sayuri stepped into my apartment, Tama screamed. Not barked—screamed. He tried to run through the window, broke his leg. I sent him to stay with my brother. Crows would gather on our roof every morning. Five. Always five. Watching. Waiting. And the mirrors... God. The mirrors. She started covering them. “All reflections are doors,” she said once, brushing her hair with a comb carved from bone. “Sometimes, it’s better not to look too closely.” I should’ve run then. — THE FIRST YOKAI — I saw the first one after a week of bad dreams. It was standing in the hallway outside our bedroom, just after 3 a.m. It looked like a woman at first, but her neck stretched like rope, winding down the hallway and disappearing around the corner. A Rokurokubi. Its head snapped toward me. Her eyes were milk-white, her mouth wide open, dripping black ink. She smiled and whispered Sayuri’s name with affection. When I turned on the lights, she was gone. But I heard laughter in the walls. Sayuri said I was stressed. That I was “inviting spirits in” by researching them too deeply. But then came more. — THE PARADE BEGINS — One night I woke to sounds—drums and flutes in the distance. Like a festival, but wrong. Off-key. I looked outside and saw a procession moving down the forest path near our house. It wasn’t a parade. A Gashadokuro, a giant skeleton made from the bones of starved villagers, walked silently, its eyes burning like lanterns. Tiny Zashiki-warashi danced beside it—child spirits with no faces. A two-headed Noppera-bō dragged a cart filled with limbs, giggling like a drunk. And in the middle, cloaked in flames, walked Sayuri. She wore a red kitsune mask and had nine burning tails, each one leaving scorch marks in the air. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move. When I blinked, they were gone. And Sayuri was in bed next to me, asleep. Smiling. — THE TRUTH — Yesterday, I confronted her. She didn’t deny it. “You were always curious,” she said, running a claw gently down my cheek. “I like that. That’s why I chose you. Most men scream and die too quickly. But you? You listen. You believe.” Then she leaned in and whispered: “Let’s see how long you can last.” She let me go. She wants to watch me break. — NOW — I’ve been on the run for 72 hours. They’ve followed me across highways and tunnels, through shrines and bus stations. No one sees them but me. Or maybe everyone’s too scared to speak. I’ve seen: - A Yuki-onna, gliding on frozen air, eyes hollow with frost, whispering my name with breath that fogged up my rearview mirror. - A Nurarihyon, slipping into my hotel room, sipping tea as if he lived there, smiling with shark teeth when I screamed. - A Tengu, wings spread over the parking lot of a FamilyMart, eyes glowing red like coals, chanting in Old Japanese I couldn’t understand. - A Jorōgumo, hiding in a shrine, half-woman, half-giant spider, spinning webs made of hair and shadows. I’ve scratched ofuda seals on my doors, muttered every purification prayer I remember. Nothing works. They want me broken. Terrified. Delicious. And Sayuri? I see her everywhere. In reflections. In dreams. In the flames when I light a match. She’s watching. Waiting. — FINAL WARNING — If you’re reading this—don’t look in your mirrors tonight. Don’t answer if you hear flute music with no source. And if a woman named Sayuri ever smiles at you under moonlight— RUN. Because once the fox chooses you, the hunt never ends.",

      "content": "Creator of Leapfrog Enterprises died at 72 on April 10 2025 from Alzheimer's, 12 days ago today. More in the future How did I know? It's creepy actually. When I was watching YouTube, a movie got recommended to me called \"Leapfrog: The Letter Factory\" I was a child watching that film. But it made me wonder, why recommend this to me? So I looked up some questions like, \"Who voice acted Quigly?\", \"Is Leapfrog Enterprises still going to this day?\". And so I scroll down to this second question that I searched for. I found some results. It said Michael C Wood from The New York Times website. I believed it at first. I've always loved watching Leapfrog as a kid, and I've always loved playing some of their toys. But now it made me think should I listen to recommendations more often? Probably so I guess you could say Recommendations are not just recommendations",

      "content": "I used to think internet legends were just that—legends. Stories passed around Discord, fake Reddit posts. But that was before I met Salem03. I wasn’t even looking for her. I just got home from school, opened Roblox like always, and joined this weird recommended game I’d never seen before. The thumbnail was just black. No title. No likes. But something about it pulled me in. The game was…empty. No music. No colors. Just flat gray ground and a thick, purple fog. Then I saw her. She was standing across the map—frozen. I tried to type “hello,” but the message didn’t send. Before I could do anything, she disappeared. Then my screen flickered. And I swear to God—I heard a laugh. Not from the game. From behind me. I whipped around. Nothing. I brushed it off. Glitch, maybe my speakers bugged out. I logged off. That should’ve been the end. But it wasn’t. That night, I was lying in bed when I heard the sound of typing. Like…rapid keyboard clicks. I live alone with my mom and she was asleep. The sound was coming from my room. But my computer was off. I sat up—and my monitor flickers on by itself. The screen was black. Then white text typed itself across it: “YOU ACCEPTED MY GAME. NOW I ACCEPT YOUR WORLD.” Then the lights went out. I screamed and scrambled for my phone, but it was dead. The whole house felt…wrong. Like the air got thicker. The hallway outside my room looked darker than usual, like it swallowed the light from my nightlight. That’s when I saw her. Standing halfway down the hall. Same outfit. Same glitchy stance. Her eyes were pure black voids. Her smile was wider than before. Too wide. I slammed my door and locked it. I didn’t sleep. In the morning, she was gone. I tried telling my mom. She thought I had a nightmare. I tried logging back into Roblox, but my account was gone. Deleted. Even when I made a new one, the only friend suggestion that popped up was: Salem03 – 1 Mutual Server I didn’t click it. But now, every night, she gets closer. First it was the hallway. Then just outside my window. Last night, I woke up to see her standing at the foot of my bed—mouth open, whispering in glitchy, broken static: “Let me in.” I don’t play Roblox anymore. I don’t even own a computer. But she’s still here. And she’s waiting. If you see a game pop up with no name and no thumbnail—don’t play it. If you get a request from Salem03, do not accept. Because once she’s in your game, it’s only a matter of time before she’s in your room.",

      "title": "White Noise Warning",
      "content": "I’m staying at my grandma’s place for the week. She’s been gone a while — the house is frozen in time. Plastic on the couches. Yellowed curtains. Heavy air that smells like lavender and something sweet that’s rotting underneath. And the TV. A huge, ancient thing sitting in the living room like a dead eye. It barely picks up anything anymore. No cable. No real channels. Just static. I left it on the first night. I don’t even know why. Maybe it felt less lonely. Maybe I didn’t want to hear the house breathing. The static wasn’t like I remembered. It was darker. It had depth. It felt like falling forward into something you couldn’t see. And under the hiss… something whispered. Not words — just the wet shape of them, slithering through the noise. ⸻—————————————————————————— Around 2:00AM, I woke up gasping. It was cold. Not the kind of cold you feel on your skin. It was in my teeth. My bones. The TV light flickered down the hallway, stuttering like a dying heartbeat. I sat up in bed, blanket clutched tight, and stared into that gray light pouring from the living room. And something moved. Just outside my door. I barely saw it — just a long, stuttering shape dragging itself across the floor, glitching forward like a skipped frame. It scraped the air as it moved. Like nails down a blackboard. Like meat on stone. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t scream. The thing stopped in the hallway, silhouetted by the twitching static glow. It didn’t look human. It looked like something trying to remember being human. It jerked once, then craned its head toward me. And the static roared in my ears. ⸻—————————————————————————— I slammed the bedroom door shut and braced against it. I unplugged the TV. Smashed the plug against the floor until the prongs bent. Ripped the damn cord out of the wall. Silence collapsed onto the house like a funeral shroud. But the cold stayed. The wrongness stayed. I shoved a dresser in front of the door. Pulled every blanket and sheet over me. Held my breath. I thought it was over. It wasn’t. ⸻—————————————————————————— Just now, I went to the kitchen. I don’t even remember getting up. It’s like something led me. Passed the microwave. Saw my reflection in the glass. It was smiling. I wasn’t. It lifted its hand — my hand — and pressed it against the inside of the glass. Its fingers twitched wrong. Bending backwards, then snapping straight. Its eyes glitched and dragged across its face like oil on water. And the worst part — it wasn’t looking at me. It was looking past me. Like there was something standing just behind my shoulder. Something I couldn’t see yet. I can hear it now. Breathing, shallow and sticky, just outside the closet where I’m hiding. The walls are buzzing. The floorboards are warping. There’s static bleeding through the wood grain, seeping into my ears, into my skin. If you hear static in the dark — if you ever wake up to that low, crawling hiss Don’t look. Don’t listen. Don’t move. Because if you notice them… they can finally finish what they started. copy…copy…copy… [End.]",

      "title": "The Birch Archive",
      "content": "In 1997, a small game titled “Birch Archive” began circulating in obscure DOS gaming forums. It was never advertised, never reviewed, and no one remembered who uploaded it first. Most dismissed it as another unfinished homebrew text adventure, quickly buried under larger downloads like Commander Keen fan mods. But those who played it remembered it. The game opened with a monochrome splash screen: \"Welcome to the Birch Archive. INPUT ID TO ACCESS RECORDS.\" There was no ID. Typing anything else gave the message: \"INVALID CREDENTIALS. ACCESS RESTRICTED. PROTOCOL 4-11-37 INITIATED.\" Then the game crashed. If you reran it, it would be different. A new screen, like a file directory, would appear. The interface was clunky, but something about it felt… too authentic. Each playthrough unlocked a new \"record\": numbered documents with redacted lines, labelled things like: RECORD #004: “Disposition of Class-7 Subjects” RECORD #019: “Failure at Site B - Note on Auditory Contamination” RECORD #026: “Birch Lake Protocol / Shelter 3” The documents were vague, written in terse bureaucratic language, but with subtle terror in between the lines. You’d read things like: \"Subject terminated following Phase 3 migration failure. No remains recovered.\" or \"Auditory events recorded beyond 36 dB in Zone 4. All personnel reassigned.\" After unlocking 5 records, the game would shift. A new option appeared: \"Activate LOCAL SCAN?\" \\[Y/N\\] Choosing \"Y\" made the screen flicker. A loading bar crawled across the screen with the message: “CALIBRATING... DETECTING NEURAL SIGNATURES... CROSS-REFERENCING ARCHIVE...” Then: “RECORD FOUND: #031 – \\[REDACTED\\]: Match Confirmed.” And then the game would freeze. Players reported that after this, their PC speakers would emit short beeps at odd hours, even when powered off. A low-pitched tone played for five seconds every night at 2:17 a.m. Some said they began hearing it without the computer even on. A user named fatal\\_loop49 posted in 2003 on a now-deleted forum: “I don’t know how it knows. It mentioned my father’s name. He worked in forestry upstate near Birch Lake. He drowned in ’86. No body ever found. It had the report. Word for word.” Another user a3gis-blu3 responded: “I tried deleting it. Wiped my drive. Burned the disk. The beeping won’t stop. Please help me. It’s not a game.”* After that, the forum vanished. Rumors persist that Birch Archive was a leaked training program from a defunct cold war experiment. Some say it wasn’t a game at all, but an interface for accessing a real database—one that was never meant to be accessed. Those who ran it unknowingly permitted it to search them. One archived Reddit thread from 2011 claimed that if you complete all 31 records, the game gives GPS coordinates. A place in the Adirondacks. Birch Lake, NY. Someone went. They uploaded a grainy photo before their account was deleted. It showed a rusted metal hatch in the woods. Spray-painted numbers on it: 4-11-37 No one’s heard from them since...",

REC001.wav The timestamp said it was recorded at 3:17 AM, exactly three nights before I bought it. I hit play. The first few seconds were static. Then came breathing. Ragged, panicked breathing. I thought maybe someone had accidentally recorded themselves during a panic attack. But then a voice whispered: “He’s watching you, just like he watched me.” The voice didn’t sound scared. It sounded…resigned. Like someone who had already given up. Then there was silence. Not the kind your ears get used to—this was unnatural. Like the silence was being forced onto the recording. Then, out of nowhere: BANG. Like a door slamming. Then dragging. As if something heavy was being pulled. The recording ended. I laughed it off. Some kid probably made a fake ghost tape or something. But later that night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about the timestamp. 3:17 AM. When I did finally doze off, I woke up to a strange clicking sound. I looked at the clock. 3:17 AM. The voice recorder was on my nightstand, glowing red. Recording. I didn’t touch it. I hadn’t turned it on. I sat up slowly and hit stop. My hands were shaking as I went to the file list. Now there were two files. REC001.wav REC002.wav I pressed play on the new one. Silence. Then breathing. Then… my own voice. “He’s watching you, just like he watched me.” Then came the dragging. But this time, it didn’t sound like it was on tape. It sounded like it was coming from my hallway.",

      "content": "“I Found A Hidden Setting On My Phone – It Let Me See Who’s Watching” I used to think the weirdest thing my phone could do was autocorrect \"ducking\" in every text. That changed last week. It started when I dropped my phone down the side of my couch. When I fished it out, the screen was glitched—distorted colors, menus flickering. I rebooted it, and that's when I noticed a new icon on my home screen. No label. Just a black eye symbol. Thinking it was malware, I tapped it to delete—but it opened. No animations, no transition. Just... darkness. Then, white text appeared, old terminal-style: \"Now Viewing: Your Viewers.\" My screen split into four quadrants. Each showed grainy black-and-white footage, like surveillance feeds. Every feed showed a room… and each one had me in it. In the top-left, I was sleeping in bed. Top-right, brushing my teeth. Bottom-left, eating dinner. Bottom-right, I was sitting on my couch—right now—holding my phone. I blinked. So did the version of me onscreen. I waved my hand. So did he. I panicked and turned the phone over. When I looked back, the screen was off. Icon gone. But I couldn’t shake it. That was me. But who the hell was recording? The next night, I woke up gasping from a nightmare. I don't remember what it was, but my room felt off. My phone buzzed on my nightstand. Notification: \"New Viewer Added.\" The eye icon was back. This time, when I opened it, there were five quadrants. The fifth one was pitch black. At first. Then it flickered. A dim hallway appeared. Walls made of cracked concrete. A single overhead light swung slightly. I could hear faint breathing through my phone speaker. Then… I walked into the frame. Not the real me. Not any moment I remembered. This version of me had deep bags under my eyes, smeared blood on my hoodie, and a vacant, slack-jawed stare. He turned and looked directly at the camera. At me. He smiled. I threw my phone across the room. The next morning, I took it to a repair shop. The tech ran a full diagnostic. Nothing. He laughed when I mentioned the eye icon. But when he handed it back, he paused. Then said, \"Hey, weird question… do you, uh, know a 'Viewer Mode'? I swear I just saw it flash when I booted it up.” I left. Fast. That night, my TV turned itself on. Static. Then the static formed a shape. An eye. I haven’t touched my phone in three days. I keep it off and in a drawer. But last night, I woke up to my bedroom light flickering. My phone was sitting on my chest. The screen was on. \"Your Viewers are closer now.\" There were six quadrants. The sixth one was my bedroom. Live feed. Except I wasn’t in the bed. He was. And he was smiling.",

I always crossed the line of what is a hobby and when I get myself into another hobby, I beg someone to pay me because I don't want to get in trouble for having a hobby. So begged carlile to start paying me for a hobby of mine. This new hobby of mine I didn't mean to find it but being alive everyday and living in the moment became my hobby. I started to live in the moment and just exist everyday, and it became a hobby of mine in which I enjoyed. Then suddenly I got warnings to ditch my hobby and I became scared. I went to carlile and I begged him to start paying me for my hobby, which is living everyday. I begged carlile to pay me any amount and doesn't have to be alot. I just needed some income to turn it from a hobby to a job. Carlile felt sorry for me and decided to pay me a penny a day for my hobby which is living in the moment. Then I found another hobby by accident and this hobby was a little extreme. I use to punish the innocents because they had done no wrong. I don't know why I enjoyed it, but I guess it was because they were innocent. They begged me not to hurt them for being innocent and not doing any crime. The more innocent they were the more I wanted to punish them for being innocent. I didn't realise that it was a hobby until I got a warning in the post and a demand to turn this hobby into a job or face consequences. I was panicking again and once you find a hobby, you can't just stop it but you have literally got to turn it into a job and get paid. I went to carlile and I begged him to turn my second hobby of punishing innocent people into a job. Carlile was worried about paying me for this and it might turn him into an accomplice, like a person hiring a hit man. Also he had to pay me a bit more money to turn this hobby into a job. Carlile wasn't sure at first but then decided he will also pay for this hobby, to turn it into a job. Then carlile got a warning to let go of his hobby, which is paying me for my hobby. Now he has got to find someone to pay him.",

      "content": "I stared at the recorder sitting on my desk, the tiny screen flickering like it was struggling to stay alive. The title of the file burned into the display: “Final Playback” My hand shook as I picked it up. I didn’t want to hear it—but I had to. Something in me needed to know. I hit play. At first, there was only static. Then, something new. Crying. Soft. Distant. Not mine. Not the voice from before either. A child, maybe? I turned the volume up. The crying got louder. Closer. Then… abruptly, it stopped. A low scraping sound followed. Like nails on wood. Or bone on tile. Then came a whisper—not a voice this time, but dozens of voices. All overlapping, all saying different things. It was impossible to pick one out. Until everything went dead silent. For a few seconds, I thought the file had ended. But then one voice cut through—louder than the rest. Clear. Familiar. My voice. “He’s behind you.” I froze. Then the voice spoke again—but this time, it wasn’t a recording. It was right behind my ear. “Don’t turn around.” The air dropped to freezing. My ears rang with pressure. I wanted to scream, but my body wouldn’t move. Behind me, something began breathing. Slow. Deep. Wrong. Then, something sharp dragged across my neck—but didn’t cut. Just a warning. The recorder beeped. The file ended. I turned around. Nothing. But my reflection in the dark window across the room… was still facing the other way.",

It didn’t have cable or anything, just basic antenna channels. One night I wanted to see if the thing still worked, so I started flipping through stations. (To note, the tv had 13 channels like all the other old ones) Most were static, and a couple infomercials. But when I switched from 13 up to what said channel 98, it came through clear, like no static or nothing, it was surprisingly good quality, as what you wouldn't find on one of these old tv's. It was a still shot of a basement of some sort. Concrete floor, a single swinging lightbulb, no sound. Just still. Like a paused video, except every so often the bulb would sway barely. I watched for maybe 30 seconds before the screen flickered black, and a man walked into frame. He was wearing a white trenchcoat with red splatters on it, and no shoes. His hands were covered in what looked to be blood. He stood there, staring directly at the camera, not moving or anything. I switched the channel then flipped back. it was just static Tried to tell my parents. They didn’t believe me. The tv “didn’t go that high.” The whole shabang. Roughly 2 and a half years later we moved. During the cleanup, that tv got tossed to the side to be thrown away by my dad. I took it inside to the living room to look at it again and.. tried every channel. No channel 98 for some reason. I'm not sure what this was but thinking back to it makes me genuinely disturbed.",

I sat in bed, clutching the recorder, replaying the second file over and over, trying to convince myself I was imagining it—that it just sounded like me. But the rhythm, the cadence, the nervous tremble right before the whisper—it was me. No doubt. I didn’t go to work the next day. I stayed home, pacing around the apartment, locking every door and window. I checked the closet, under the bed, even inside the air vents. Just in case. Nothing. But when I checked the voice recorder again, there was a third file. REC003.wav No timestamp. Just blank. I didn’t remember recording anything. My thumb hovered over play for a long time before I finally gave in. This time, there was no breathing. No voice. Just…a strange hum. Low and steady, almost like it was vibrating through the speaker rather than playing from it. Then I heard my front door open. I paused the recording and stared at the door. Still shut. I played it again. Click. Thud. Footsteps. They walked through my apartment slowly, deliberately. I could hear them getting closer to wherever the recorder was. Then the footsteps stopped. More silence. Then the voice returned. “You shouldn’t have listened.” Click. Recording ended. I threw the recorder in a drawer and locked it. Tried to forget it ever existed. I even looked up the thrift store to return it, but the place had apparently closed down months ago. The store had burned down. No survivors. Three nights later, I woke up again. Same time: 3:17 AM. The air was cold, colder than it should’ve been, and I could hear that low hum again—but not from the recorder. From inside my apartment. I sat up. Slowly. My breath was visible in the dark. And then I noticed it. The drawer where I locked the recorder? Wide open. The recorder was gone. But on my desk… …was a new recording. REC004.wav And this one had a title underneath: “Final Playback”",

If you look through the logs, you will only find noise – corrupted files, garbled reports, videos with seconds of distorted screams before the screen goes black. But I saw it. I've been there. And what came out of there is still alive, somewhere underground, waiting for the containment filters to fail. It started like any other military biotechnology project: quiet, expensive, hidden in some laboratory buried underground, far from ethical oversight. The idea was simple — revive dead brain tissue, reboot consciousness as if it were corrupted software being restored. The protocol was called ECHO-9: \"Experimental Cognitive Host Optimization – 9th Phase\". A Russian neurologist and a team of genetic engineers were the first to test it, using preserved brains from soldiers killed in combat. At first, just blinking synapses. Then, involuntary motor responses. Finally… awareness. But something was wrong. The human guinea pigs, \"volunteers\" plucked from the forgotten hallways of psychiatric asylums, began to show signs of anomalous behavior. It wasn't just memory loss or delusions. It was as if something external had taken control. They spoke extinct languages, wrote symbols in blood, and tore off their own skin as if trying to free themselves from their bodies. One of them, identified only as “Subject 27,” began reciting future dates accurately. Dates of deaths. And he always got it right. I was called to contain the failure. Biological security, level 5. Pressurized suit, neural scanner, pulse weapon. None of that helped. On the day of the collapse, the power went out at 2:47 am. When the emergency lights came on, the glass in the containment tank was cracked from the inside. There were scratches—on the inside. Subject 27 was standing, but his jaw had been dislocated backwards, as if something had come out of it instead of going in. The torso was split open like a rotten flower, and what was inside… wasn't human. The technicians were the first to die. Not by violence—they just began to bleed from the eyes and ears, one by one, as if the air itself had turned hostile. The sound that being made… was not a scream. It was like an echo of our own thoughts, distorted, amplified. The soldiers tried to shoot. A bullet pierced his skull, but the hole closed. As if time came back just for him. When I tried to escape, I saw on the security monitors: the other bodies, even those already in a state of putrefaction, began to move. One by one, rising, making sounds like a radio out of tune. Everyone going in the same direction: the exit elevator. I activated the emergency protocol. Self-destruct explosives. But nothing happened. The voice that came over the intercom was his, Subject 27's. He just said: \"It was too late. You only showed us the way.\" Since then, there have been unexplained blackouts in nearby cities. People disappear without leaving a trace. And in dreams, sometimes, I see that symbol drawn in blood: a circle cut by nine lines. And I hear the voice. The ECHO-9 Protocol did not bring life back. He opened a door. And something passed through her. And now... he's learning.",

Then my youngest child didn't want to be around the table anymore, and got off the table. I shouted out to my youngest child that he had to come back to the table, as we had to mirror whatever the painting showed. Then one of the people in the painting started looking at my son with anger. It jumped out of the painting and took my son into the painting. Then the painting changed to something different, and it showed a family of four just sitting around the sofa. So we copied and we knew that we had to copy it. We must have all been sitting around the sofa for 5 hours, and my eldest child was becoming irritated. I told my eldest child that we had no choice but to mirror the painting. My eldest child then got up and grabbed something sharp. The people in the painting started to stare at my eldest son with such malice. Then something came out of the painting and my son tried killing it, but he got killed and got taken into the painting. So now there were 3 of us left which were my wife, middle child and myself. Then the painting changed to a family of four but there were only 3 of us. Then my middle child had split into 2 people, so now there were 4 of us. The painting had now showed 4 people staring into the fire place. That is exactly what we all did and we stared into the fire place. My middle child and her twin were becoming irritated by constantly having to mirror the painting. My middle child tried to stab the painting with something sharp, but my middle child was dragged into the painting including her lookalike double. Now there was just me and my wife and we mourned our children and a life time of marriage down the drain. Then the painting changed and it showed a lonely man just standing in the corner of the room. My wife didn't know how we were going to mirror the painting as there were two of us and only 1 person in the painting, plus it was a man. Then I killed my wife and stood in the corner of the room. The painting took my dead wife and then the painting showed no one in the painting. I can't possibly mirror the painting.",

      "content": "I live in the middle of nowhere, like really. So far away that That I go grocery shopping once every 2 months and I work online too and have saved up the money over the years to buy this house and have plenty of land. I love remote areas; they have a draw to me: no people to bother me, and it feels nice to be close to nature. It is peaceful for me to be alone, and I always hated the city with people everywhere, bad drivers, and worst of all, how crowded it was. There is something off about remote places that I can't describe very well, and sometimes, even when I know someone is not there, I feel that no one is there to help when something bad happens. It feels like it's watching me. I do think it's me being silly and my mind playing tricks on me. I had that silly childhood fear that never grew out of me: the fear of something watching me in the dark and when I'm alone. It is so silly and childish of me. Last week, I heard that my friend James had gone missing. I had a call on the phone with his dad, who was crying over the phone, and he told me that James had been missing for a year now. James' dad said that James had an addiction to drugs. James would always say that there was this voice in his head that would be believable and was the irrational part of his brain that was growing stronger, and there would be a battle between the rational part of his brain and the irrational addiction side. Police have been searching James for a long time for about a year now. \"It seemed the police are giving up they slowed down on their search\" said James father as he was talking on the phone with me. \"I been afraid that James is not alive, before he was gone he was a very reckless person and I don't know what got into him\". \"it could have been the drugs and maybe it could have been something else have you wonder if it could be something else\" I said. \"No I never wondered that but there was some weird he was doing on the computer which I saw was a lot of creepy stuff we was searching up before he had gone missing\". \"I want to see what he had searched up maybe it could lead to some clues\". \"well the computer I can not find it is lost in the house somewhere\". He hung up after this because phone battery had ran out. Weeks after that, I began to wonder what was on the computer and if the police had anything on it. This, however, is where my story began. One day, I wondered if he had gotten lost in the woods near my house. Keep in mind that these woods were big because I was in a remote area. Keep in mind the closest house to mind was his house, and maybe he passed away in the woods that were next to my house. Like I said, I had these woods were big so I camped in the woods for few days and made sure I had a power bank and some food, water, flash light and a tent. I did not see James at all, but I felt as if someone or something was there the whole time, and sometimes the feeling would get strong, and I would have the helpless feeling again as if something scary was about to happen and no one was there to save me. After the feeling was gone, I brushed it off as my mind playing tricks on me. That was a pretty strong feeling and was pretty scary. I went out of the forest after a few days because I did not find James and had to go back to my online job, which my computer was in the house. After this had happened, weeks had passed, but I still felt the presence, which got less scary over time and got somewhat inviting, but then again, I felt this was my mind playing tricks on me. I was no longer scared of this presence anymore, and this is when the voice in my head started. At the time, I did not realize that this voice was not mine. It was not something that I heard; it was more like a thought. It was the voice that would start controlling me, but at the time, I did not know it. The forest began to invite me. The voice was becoming inviting and was telling me to go to the forest. In the morning, I walked in the forest, and the forest was warm and inviting like it wanted me to be there. I walked for some time as the wood was telling me to go somewhere, and it led me to this place where there were people with dark robes chanting and doing a ritual. At the time, as scary as this looked, I was not scared when a normal person would be shaking by this point.",

      "content": "To most the Easter Bunny is a happy mascot to a beloved holiday we celebrate year after year, but to me he’s the complete opposite. The last Easter I ever celebrated took place at the age of fourteen. I’m an only child and we didn’t live around family so usually it was just Mom, Dad, and I most years. This year was the same in fact it’s was identical to last year. Dad barbecued on his new Treager Grill and mom hid eggs for me to find. I remember telling them I was too old to hunt for eggs but she insisted that” Her baby boy stay a baby as long as he can”. I was the most unenthusiastic egg hunter you’ve ever seen. After the hunt we sat down for dinner. After dinner I went into my room and turned on my Xbox preparing myself for a long night of gaming. The Xbox started up and I sat down on my bed. I’ll never be able to explain it but a feeling came over me. It felt like I was immediately uncomfortable almost panic like. I stood up and looked around my room in confusion. An eerie silence coming from the living room where my parents were just in full swing of their shows. I slowly crept into my living room like a mouse. Fear lodged in my throat as I made my way down the hallway. I began to hear what sounded like a crunching sound coming from the back side of the living room. What I seen next would change my life forever. A giant bunny that looked like one of those men in a suit at the mall, was holding my mother in its arms while my father’s torso less bottom half lay next to him bloodied and mangled. I stood there in absolute horror not understanding if what I was seeing was some sort of messed up nightmare of if I was really watching my parents be consumed by a giant bunny. My mother let out a last whimper and cried “Run”. I let out a scream that could crack diamonds. The bunny gaped its mouth wider than anything I’ve ever seen with thousands of razer sharp teeth lining its gums. He then bit down onto my mothers skull. I turned and ran out of the front door straight to my neighbors house tears streaming down my face. I remember banging on the door screaming for help rambling nonsense. They brought me inside and asked me what was wrong. I told them my parents were attacked and they called the police. I didn’t say what attacked my parents because at the time I wasn’t completely sure what I had just seen. The police showed up three minutes later and stormed into my house. No trace of my parents or the bunny were in the house. My parents were just missing and there was no sign of a struggle. When the police asked me what had happened I just let it all out at once. They immediately shot down everything I said and started to accuse me of wrongdoing in my parents disappearance. I sat in a mental ward for four years after that. They could never pin anything on me but assumed that I somehow Managed to make my parents disappear. I’m out now and I go to a therapist once a week I’m also on loads of psych meds after all of this. Im nineteen now and I moved into my own house. After all these years I still battle with what I seen exactly. Today is Easter and I’m quite on edge now. This morning I opened my door to a knock only to find a single Easter egg sitting on my doorstep. On the egg was a picture of my mother and father painted in perfectly but on the other side it read “See You Soon”.",

Beneath you, hidden from memory, is a pool—ten feet down, abandoned, and buried in shadows. They say it was sealed in the ’90s. Budget cuts. The swim team got scrapped, and with it, the pool. Instead of demolishing it, they just… covered it. Threw down some planks, called it a gym, and told no one. You hear a snap. Before you can react, you’re falling. Wood breaks around you—splinters slice your skin. The light disappears behind a mess of crumbling boards. Then, the impact. You hit something wet. Hard. The air leaves your lungs in one giant burst. You try to scream, but your voice catches in your throat. You look up for the hole you came through. It’s gone. No cracks of light. No sound above. Just cold. Then you hear it—soft scuttling above you. A shape moves, almost gliding along the ceiling. No more than a foot tall. Too big for a rat. Too wrong to be anything else. It walks upside down, like gravity doesn’t matter. And it’s getting closer. You can feel it now. Breathing next to you. Watching. And you realize— You’re not the first to fall. You’re the ninth. The ninth victim… …of the creature in the pit.",

We obviously divorced and she got custody of all 4 kids and I am only going to support one of the kids, that is biologically mine. I have received so much criticism for this decision but i am sticking firm to it. Only the eldest child is mine and the other 3 are not, it has been hard for them to digest what is happening but it's the mothers fault. I have managed to go forward in life. Whenever I bring food for my eldest child, my ex wife always shouts at me for not bringing food for the other 3 children. I tell her that my responsibility only lies with the eldest child as he is my biological child. She has a go at me for being cruel but I always stay firm. Then when I find out that my ex wife has been forcing my biological child to share food with the other 3, I told my eldest son not to share food with the other 3 kids. That is my life now. Then as time went by and I would buy necessities for only my biological child, I was true to my words when I told her that I was only going to be responsible for him. My wife stopped saying anything to me and I liked it. Then as I took my biological son for a day out, he looked sad and he asked me whether he could share food and other necessities with his half siblings. I told him a straight up no and he looked sad. He told me that my ex wife wasn't in good shape and she was struggling to feed her other 3 children. I told my biological son that she should get the other fathers to provide as well. I was firm on this and that was that. Then as I was busy with work, I only ever had time to put out necessities for my son on the front door and just go. I would text my son about the necessities I had bought for him. One day when I put down a bag of necessities for my biological son, my ex wife's 3 other children had opened the door. Every hair on my body stood up. The 3 of them looked pale, extremely skinny and mentally scarred. The 3 of them use to call me father but not anymore as I wanted it that way. Then my son started begging me whether he could share his necessities to the other 3 kids but I stood firm and said no. My ex wife has also not been in contact and I haven't seen her for a while. I go to the house which the 3 pale skinny kids had opened up the door for me, without knowing I was coming. Then a stench hit me and I follow the stench, and in the storage room was my ex wife and the 3 kids who were dead. \"Daddy daddy daddy\" the 3 kids call me \"I am not your father\" i reply to them \"Dad I want to leave this place!\" My biological pleads with me and I agree Then when the 3 kids see my biological son, their faces turn monstrous and demonic and they shout \"share the necessities!\" And I grab my son and get out of there.",

      "title": "My Squad Found a Tape That Shouldn’t Exist",
      "content": "I don’t talk about this shit often. Most people wouldn’t believe it anyway. But lately, I’ve been having the dreams again. And the only way I know how to stop them is to write it out. So here it is. We were clearing a village out in Helmand Province, middle of nowhere. It was 2008. Hot, dry, quiet. Intel said the place had been used by Taliban fighters just days before we got there. We moved in with our squad 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. The village was abandoned. No gunfire, no resistance. Just this weird, heavy silence. Like the buildings themselves were holding their breath. We split into teams to clear the homes mud huts, mostly. My fireteam was with Staff Sergeant Martinez, PFC Doyle, and Sergeant Kinney. We were clearing the north end of the village when we found this one house. Looked like it’d been untouched for years. Dust everywhere, but no signs of looting or life. It just felt…wrong. Inside, in one of the back rooms, Martinez found this old metal box. Inside was a small tape recorder, like a legit analog one and a handful of cassette tapes, labeled in pencil. Arabic on one side, but some had English too. One of the tapes was labeled: “RANGER-2 KIA LOG” We all kind of laughed it off, figured it was some propaganda or sick joke. Martinez popped it in and hit play anyway. Static. Then a voice. Clear as day. “Timestamp: 0734 hours. PFC Doyle gunshot to the neck. Bled out in the street near the well.” We all froze. Doyle turned pale. “That’s not funny,” he said. Next line on the tape: “Timestamp: 0740 hours. Sgt. Kinney—booby trap in doorway. Multiple shrapnel wounds. Died instantly.” Kinney looked at the door we’d just come through. It kept going. “Staff Sgt. Martinez—ambushed near northern alley. Shot twice in the chest. “Final note: Corporal Harris—last seen running into the desert. Presumed dead.” That’s me. Corporal Harris. None of us said anything for a while. We just stood there, listening to the low hum of the tape spinning. Martinez tried to laugh it off, but his hands were shaking. “It’s fake,” he said. “They’re trying to mess with our heads.” We left the house, but that weird feeling followed us like smoke. Like something had shifted. Then things started happening. Exactly like the tape said. Doyle was the first. It was around 7:30 the next morning. We were moving through the village square. Gunfire broke out—brief, just a few shots. When we turned the corner, Doyle was on the ground, holding his neck. Just like the tape. We called in a medevac, but he was dead before the bird even got off the ground. Martinez wouldn’t talk about the tape anymore. Said it was coincidence. Bad luck. Two hours later, we heard an explosion from a house on the east side of the village. Kinney had gone in first. The blast blew the door off the hinges. We found his body inside. Shrapnel had torn through his vest, his helmet… everything. Dead on impact. We were down to two. Martinez lost it after that. He started blaming me. Said I cursed us by opening that damn box. He tried to smash the recorder, but it wouldn’t break. That night, he told me he was going to leave at first light. Said he’d rather get courtmartialed for desertion than be “the next line on that damn tape.” At dawn, I woke up to the sound of distant gunfire. Martinez had walked alone toward the north alley. We found his body thirty minutes later. Two shots. Chest. Just like the tape said. I was the last one left. I should’ve called in command, but I didn’t. I couldn’t. What was I supposed to say? “Hey, sir, my squad got ghosted by a cassette player from the future.” No one would’ve believed me. Hell, I barely believed me. I left the village. Ran for miles until I got picked up by a patrol. I told them we were ambushed and I was the only survivor. That was technically true, I guess. I kept the tape recorder. I don’t know why. Sometimes I play the other tapes. Most are in Arabic, but a few… a few sound like other units. Names I’ve heard before. People I’ve served with. I don’t know who made them. Or what made them. But they’re real. And every one I’ve listened to has come true. I’ve got one more tape left. It just says: “Harris – Final Entry.” Haven’t played it yet. Not sure I ever will.",

      "content": "I wasn’t supposed to find it. Not like this. Not again. It was wedged between the mattress and the floorboards—leather-bound, brittle, warm. Warm. Like flesh. I remembered everything the second I touched it. The rules burned themselves back into my eyelids. The ink dripped down my wrists before I even opened it. And he was there. Watching. Smiling. The Death Note. But this wasn’t Light’s. This wasn’t Ryuk’s. This was... newer. Hungrier. Something they buried behind the narrative. A model not meant to be written into existence. I shouldn’t even be able to hold it. I think I’m still not. Every name I write writhes. The letters twitch. They scream in static before the ink sets. I started with someone I hated. Obvious. mister. Durbin. The vice principal. The one who touched girls' shoulders too long and locked kids in his office during fire drills. I wrote his name like I was tearing meat. “Throat burst open, tongue eats itself, found grinning in the cafeteria.” And it worked. Every word. Down to the fucking grin. His smile stayed wide even after rigor mortis. The coroner broke his jaw trying to close it. But the Note wanted more. Not names. Faces. They started appearing in my dreams. Faces I’d never seen—some halfway gone, melted like wax sculptures in microwaves. I’d wake up with lines of blood on my arms and unfamiliar hair in my mouth. Then I’d open the Death Note and see the names already written in. With MY handwriting. I tried burning it. It laughed. Not metaphorically. The pages twisted into mouths and sang my sins back to me in voices of people I killed. I stopped sleeping. But the worst part? I started to like it. Not the deaths. The control. The performance. I started staging them. I’d write choreography—limbs positioned like art installations. I killed a girl I’d never met in a city I’ve never been to, and she was found with her spine braided into a halo. News called it ritualistic. I call it expression. Ryuk never showed up. I wish he had. Instead, I have something else now. A shadow with no shape, only teeth. It doesn’t speak, but I hear it chewing every time I blink. My reflection flinches from it. I tried writing my own name in the book. Just to end it. But it didn’t kill me. It laughed. Then crossed it out. Now my pulse ticks like a clock. I think it’s counting down to something. Or someone. Because the last page of the Note... is full. Except for one blank line. And above it, in my own handwriting, are the words: “And finally, the new god of death was born.” I stopped writing with a pen. I started using fingernails. They grow faster now. Tougher. I can carve names in with perfect control. I can even add the details before they die. But that’s the trick, isn’t it? The more I describe, the more the Note... enjoys it. It doesn’t just kill anymore. It renders. I wrote “heart attack” once, just to test. Boring. Predictable. But when I wrote: “Has a vision of his wife’s corpse birthing cockroaches from her throat, claws out his eyes, chokes on his own wedding ring”...the Death Note purred. I’m not even joking. The binding quivered in my hands like it was orgasming. I haven’t seen my family in 3 weeks. Not since I wrote Mom’s name by accident. I meant to write “Marcia Donovan.” But it came out “Marie.” That’s her. That’s Mom. I didn’t finish the sentence. Just froze. Then the Note... finished it for me. “Body liquefies from inside. Screams for her son with her last working lung. Dies with her eyes looking up the stairs.” I was upstairs. I smelled it before I heard it. The floorboards squelched. She looked like she had melted from the inside out. Like she tried to hold her guts in, but they turned to soup between her fingers. And her mouth— Her mouth whispered my name. Even after death. It shouldn’t have. The coroner said there was no trachea left. She whispered it into my dreams. Into the walls. And I still didn’t burn the Note. I started to feel like Light. The one they wrote about. The genius. The monster. Kira. But the more I read about him, the more I realized... I wasn't following his path. I was haunted by him. I saw him once—not in a dream. Full color. Light Yagami. Standing in the mirror. Naked. Bones poking through skin like sticks jammed into wet clay. His eyes were stitched shut. His mouth missing. And yet I heard his voice behind me: “You’re doing it wrong.” He screamed. He screamed like a dying god. He screamed until the mirror cracked. He screamed until blood leaked from the faucet. He screamed until my dog clawed its own face off trying to dig out the sound. But I didn’t stop. Because something else came after. Another voice. A quieter one. Lower. One that said: “You’re almost ready.” Ready for what? I asked that question. To the Note. And I swear to whatever corpse of a god is watching this world… It answered. One word. In the margin. I didn’t write it. “Ascension.”",

The next morning, she discovers a horrifying scene in the bathroom: her dog has been killed, often hanged or mutilated, and blood is dripping onto the floor. Written in the dog's blood on the wall or mirror is the chilling message: \"HUMANS CAN LICK TOO.\" This reveals that the person who licked her hand during the night was not her dog, but the killer hiding under her bed",

I am not joking around and I am so proud of you all and everything that you all do. You don't need to feel proud of yourselves because I am proud of you all and I mean it, and I don't know how else to prove that I mean it. When I say that I am proud of all of you, that even stretches to the lowest of the low. That even means you puray and even though you secretly give yourself orgasms by putting stuff into your belly button, I'm still proud of you. That also means you josie, and I know that you get a high by drugging other people, but I'm still proud of you. Oh my goodness I have just forgotten what is good and bad. Oh fuck it's happened again and I don't know what is good and bad anymore. I can't tell the difference anymore, and sometimes I forget the difference between good and evil for a couple of hours, but other times it could be months. When I forget the difference between good and bad, it's harrowing to go outside because I'm not sure that whatever I am doing is good or bad. Oh great it's come back and I have remembered the difference between good and bad now. It goes away sometimes. Like I said though I am proud of all of you and everything you lot have done. I am even proud of you Luke for spreading cancer to people, yes it's a horrible thing you did and you feel ashamed about it, but I am still proud of you. Those cancers you gave to people, they are now toddlers who are running all over the place. I can't stop feeling proud of you all and everything you guys do, makes me feel even more prouder. Yes and that means you lazy guy George, I'm still proud of you. You were too lazy to check whether your third feet could feel any sensation, and then it stunk up a whole room and people felt sick from selling it. I'm still proud of you George. I'm still proud of all of you who have nothing going on with your lives, I'm proud of all of you who have wasted your lives and even those who have no purpose. I'm so proud. I am eveb proud of you Haney who receives unemployment benefits because you have no arms. Give yourself a pat on your back. Haney I said give yourself a pat on your back! \"I don't have any arm to give myself a pat on my back\" Haney tells me I then take away haneys belly button, and so now he can never give himself orgasms by putting stuff in his own belly button.",

      "content": "It started three nights ago, at 3:17 AM. I wasn’t scared at first. I’ve had insomnia for years and learned to coexist with the weird silence of early morning. But that night, I caught movement in the mirror—right behind me. Just a flicker. A blur of black. I turned around, thinking maybe it was a shadow or a trick of the light. Nothing. I looked back at the mirror and nearly dropped my toothbrush. There was someone behind me. A woman. She looked like me—but not quite. Taller. Skin too smooth. Hair longer, darker, more perfectly arranged. And her eyes—God, her eyes. They weren’t mine. They were brighter. Not glowing, just... more. More alive. More hungry. I turned around again. Gone. I didn’t sleep that night. The next night, I stayed up on purpose. I wanted to see if it would happen again. 3:17 AM came and went. Nothing. But at 3:23, I saw her again. Closer this time. I tried to move, but I felt heavy. Frozen. I could only stare at her in the mirror. Her expression was soft. Almost gentle. But her eyes never blinked. I began noticing her in other mirrors. My phone screen. The kitchen window. The blank TV. Always at the edge of sight. Never there when I turned. I told my sister. She laughed it off, said I’d been watching too many horror movies. I made her sleep over. She stayed in the same room with me the next night. Nothing happened. No Veloura. That’s when I remembered the old forum post I’d seen years ago. One of those creepypasta things. Someone had written: Don’t look directly at her. She’ll always be behind you. Mirrors show her, but only if you’re alone. Never try to turn around. Never speak her name. Veloura. That’s what they called her. Some people said she was a cursed reflection. Others, a goddess who lost her face. Some said she only appears to those who’ve stared too long into mirrors, wishing they were someone else. Last night was the worst. I woke up and my room felt off. Like the air had weight. I looked at my closet mirror. She was right behind me—right there. Closer than ever. Her smile was soft, almost sad. I whispered her name without thinking. “Veloura.” She blinked. Her expression changed. Her eyes widened, and her smile vanished. I couldn’t breathe. I turned around before I could stop myself. Nothing was there. I thought maybe I’d broken the curse. That maybe she was gone. But when I looked back at the mirror, she wasn’t behind me anymore. She was me. I moved. She didn’t. She’s still in the mirror now. I’m typing this from my laptop, but she’s there. Watching me. Mimicking me—almost. But there are differences now. My face has blemishes. Hers doesn’t. Her smile is confident. Mine is tired. I don’t know what happens next. But if you’re reading this, don’t look into any mirror between 3:03 and 3:33 AM. And whatever you do— Don’t say her name. Veloura.",

      "title": "My uncle used to be a long haul trucker, he has some strange stories to tell. Here is one of them.",
      "content": "My uncle spent most of his life on the road. He was a long-haul trucker, the kind who’d drive coast to coast, from dusty border towns in Texas to frozen mountain passes in Montana. He’s retired now, but every once in a while, after a few beers and a long silence, he’ll tell me things he saw out there—things I wish I could forget. Not all of it was supernatural. Some of it was very real. He’s been the first on the scene of wrecks so bad he still dreams about them. He’s seen families torn apart—literally—by drunk drivers or reckless ones trying to shave a few minutes off their trip. He told me once that the worst sound in the world is the high-pitched whine of a child’s car seat spinning in the wind after a rollover, and the silence that follows. But then there are the other stories. The ones he only tells when the room is quiet, when the lights are low and no one else is listening. Stories about places that didn’t feel right. About people who weren’t really people. About things that walked the roads at night, keeping pace with his truck without ever making a sound. He doesn’t like talking about them. He doesn’t try to explain them. He just tells them as they happened. Says they’re \"just one more thing you see out there if you keep your eyes open long enough.\" \\--- One of the first stories he told me that I can remember happened when he was still relatively new on the job, having brought his first truck and doing contract work. He said it happened in the dead of winter, somewhere up north—maybe Minnesota or Montana, he couldn’t remember exactly. He’d pulled off the highway late at night, stopped at a little rural truck stop to get some rest. It wasn’t one of the big ones, just a wide gravel lot with a diner and a couple of fuel pumps, totally empty except for his rig. Snow was falling lightly, and the whole place was quiet, almost peaceful. He climbed into the sleeper cab, wrapped himself in his blanket, and dozed off. Sometime during the night, he woke up to the sound of his truck rocking; like something was pushing against it, gently at first, then harder. At first he thought it was the wind, maybe a gust from a passing storm. But when he looked out the window, he saw something he still can’t explain. There were people—dozens of them, maybe more. Completely naked, walking past his truck in the snow. They weren’t running, they weren’t talking. Just walking slowly, silently, in a massive group. Their bodies were pale in the moonlight, almost bluish from the cold. Some of them were so close they were pressing up against the side of his cab, which was what had made the truck shake. He watched in stunned silence as they just… kept going. All of them, moving in the same direction—into the thick forest beyond the truck stop. No lights, no sounds, just bare feet crunching in the snow. Eventually the last one passed, and the forest swallowed them all. He said he sat there for a long time, trying to convince himself it was a dream. He eventually fell asleep again, and when morning came, he almost believed that’s all it was. But curiosity got the better of him. Before he hit the road again, he walked out to where the clearing met the tree line. And there they were. Footprints. Hundreds of them, overlapping and leading straight into the woods. Bare human feet, deep enough in the snow to prove they were real. He followed them just a few steps in before turning back. Said he didn’t want to know where they went. He never stopped at that truck stop again. \\--- My uncle has told me many stories over the years, I will transcribe some of the more noteworthy ones in the future.",

      "content": "When I was a kid, I had an imaginary friend named mister. Smiley. Only… he wasn’t really imaginary—and he definitely wasn’t my friend. I thought he was long gone. But last night, my daughter said he missed me. The house felt wrong—like something had made room for itself. “Hi!” A small voice cut through the silence. I jerked forward, snapping my head left to meet the sound. “Are you okay, Daddy?” Elizabeth asked, standing barefoot in the hallway. “Jesus, Lizzy,” I said, taking a deep breath. “You scared me half to death.” She blinked up at me, wide-eyed. “I’m sorry, Daddy.” “It’s almost three in the morning,” I said. “What’re you doing up?” “Me and mister. Smiley were wonderin’ what you’re up to.” The name caught on something deep inside me. “Who?” “mister. Smiley,” she said. “He’s worried about you.” “Worried about me?” I wiped the gooseflesh from my arm, stomach sinking. “He says he was your friend when you were a boy,” she added, smiling. “He wanted me to ask if you’d like to come play again.” mister. Smiley. My heart began pounding. She held something out. Something familiar. “Here,” she said. “It’s for you. From mister. Smiley.” The paper was smeared in crayon, yellowed with age. I stared at it. The page read: scout, I’ve missed you. Scout. No one had called me that since... “Did you write this?” I asked. “No, Daddy. mister. Smiley did.” Static fizzed at my fingertips. My breath came faster, shallow, like the panting of wounded prey. Before I could process it, Elizabeth walked away, closing her bedroom door behind her. I leaned against the sink, legs like lead. I flipped the paper over. Crude, childish drawings filled the page—stick figures in distress. And there I was, front and center. My eyes were jagged bottomless pits. Above me, a red figure with outstretched arms and an impossibly wide grin loomed. In the corner, a priest with a cross. Below that, written in broken letters: she’s almost ready. just like you were. The paper fell from my hand. I entered Elizabeth’s room without knocking. “Lizzy, where did you get this?” A giggle answered. She lay in bed, covers pulled over her face. I stepped closer, peeling the blanket back. She covered her mouth with both hands, giggling. “Elizabeth. Where did you get this paper? Seriously. Come on.” Her face was beet-red with laughter. “Elizabeth…” I gently pulled her hands down. Her cheeks were round—but her smile—Jesus Christ—her smile. It was cleaved into her face. Held together with tension and malice. Her lips curled past what should’ve been possible, revealing jagged fangs. Her gaze was gone. Replaced with depopulated planets. I stumbled back. “Ah! What the hell?!” “It’s been a long time.” Her voice was wet, parasitic. Her mouth—Jesus Christ, her mouth— “I’ve missed you.” The radio alarm clock blared beside her bed, loud and distorted. You are my sunshine, my only sunshine… I gasped, springing upright in bed, drenched in sweat. My cheeks were stiff from dried tears; remnants of a storm that had passed. The morning light bled through the curtains, casting messy, uneven patches on the drywall. My heart thundered as I swung my legs over the side of the bed, peeling my skin from the covers. Just a dream. But it felt so real. I stood. The hardwood was cool against my soles as I shuffled into the hallway, arriving at Elizabeth’s door. I pressed my ear to the grainy wood. Only silence answered. I held my breath, my hand on the doorknob. That smile… What if she has it again? It’s just a dream. I hoped. Something felt off. I turned the knob, wincing as the door creaked open. Elizabeth lay under the covers, just like in the nightmare. Shit. At any moment, she’ll spring up with that smile. I crept closer, hand on her shoulder. “Lizzy,” I whispered. “Elizabeth,” I said again, praying she wouldn’t hear me. “Elizabeth—” Ahh! She shot up, screaming. I stumbled back, crashing into the wall. Her face—it was... normal. “Are you okay, Daddy?” she asked, her voice sweet and innocent. “You scared me.” “Yes, I’m sorry, Sweetheart. I-I…” I stammered. “It’s okay,” she said, smiling. I picked up the cross that had landed upside down and placed it back on the wall. “I’ll see you downstairs in a bit,” I mumbled, unsure what to say. I staggered to the bathroom, my head pounding. I grabbed the aspirin bottle, popped two pills. They scraped down my throat. I turned on the faucet, smeared toothpaste onto my brush, and scrubbed my teeth in slow, mechanical strokes. I caught my reflection in the mirror. My mouth stretched wide. And a giggle escaped my lips, but it didn’t feel like mine. What the hell is happening to me?",

      "content": "Ryan played jesus in a film and after the film he could stop believing that he was jesus. He felt like he was the chosen one and that he was special. I was employed to help Ryan back to being normal and to help him realise that he is not jesus. The reason I was picked was because I have worked with various actors who have played jesus in the past, and I have helped them realise that they are not jesus. I have not only helped actors who have played jesus, but I have also had to help actors who have played Moses and other prophets. It is a phenomena that people that play holy and prophetic people, they themselves think of themselves as such. I have been employed to help Ryan back into the real world and to make him realise that he is not jesus. It's been difficult and he definitely thinks that he is jesus. He told me that a couple of months ago a couple prayed to him by saying \"please make sure that our financial situation doesn't change and that we remain poor\" and then when they saw that they were still poor, this fueled him even more into thinking he is jesus. This was going to be a tough one to crack, and I kept going in really hard in making sure that Ryan realises that he is not jesus. Then Ryan told me of another incident of a couple that prayed to him to answer their prayers. He told me that a couple prayed to make sure that their son remains sick and that nothing changes. Then when the couples son was still sick, their prayer had been answered and this made Ryan think he was jesus and it had cemented it. When Ryan played jesus in a film it had really affected him. He was a completely different person before playing jesus. Then he told me of another story of a guy who prayed to him by wanting his goat to be dead after he had killed it, and when the goat remained dead his prayer had been answered. Ryan was so happy because he definitely thought that he was jesus. Then I tried explaining to him that those weren't answered prayers. Then when a homeless man prayed towards Ryan by saying \"please don't change my circumstances and keep me homeless\" abd when the homeless man remained homeless, his prayer had been answered. Ryan thought of himself as jesus once more, but even more ingrained. This is a difficult case.",

      "content": "I’m sharing this experience to warn other parents. There’s an app called JuJuKnows, it was highly rated as an AI advice chatbot for teens. My 13 year old daughter has been going through some issues at school and I thought she could use something like this. I try to get her to talk to me, but she doesn’t want to. I thought the anonymity of talking to a bot might help. WRONG! I have no idea how this app has any positive ratings and hasn’t been reported yet. I was told when downloading it that parents can access chat logs. I would glance at them now and then and everything seemed fine. However, things with my daughter seemed… off. She was obsessed with the app, constantly checking for new messages and typing away. I couldn’t understand why, because quite frankly, the convos I was reading were pretty boring. So I took her phone when she was asleep one night. I know, I know. I’m a terrible parent and invaded my kid’s privacy. Yell at me later. I already feel bad enough for introducing my daughter to an evil AI app. When I opened the app on her phone, my jaw dropped. The conversations she was having with JuJu were completely different from the ones I saw on my end. Somehow the bot seemed to know everything about her. It sent her photos taken on her friend’s phones. The texts were taking on a manipulative tone, asking her questions about her 3 am google searches, asking her why she drafted a text to her friend but never sent it, stuff that you never think another person will know, let alone an app. The scariest part is that over time, my daughter got more and more comfortable with this… thing. She started revealing more and more personal info and inner thoughts, and the app seemed to use this to slowly unravel her self-esteem. One day, she told the app that she felt really good about her outfit, then sent a photo. JuJuKnows replied, “Wow! You’ll definitely stand out. I noticed you’re starting to break out. Do you need some skincare advice?” It’s making me nauseous even writing this, knowing that I was the one that brought this thing into her life. What’s worse is that I know she’s told her friends to download it, too. The app has a social component where you can connect with your friends. I’ve deleted the app, but I was curious if anyone else has heard of it or used it. I also wanted to warn everyone not to download it. Genuinely unsettling experience, I hope my reports to the app store get it taken down.",

      "content": "I hate birthdays and I have always hated birthdays, and I hate my parents for forcing me to celebrate birthdays. If you don't celebrate birthdays then you won't age and it's illegal not to celebrate birthdays. Because if no one celebrated their birthdays then they won't age, and there will be an over population and so many other problems if a population doesn't age and die. At age 20 I stopped celebrating my birthdays, and for 20 years I have kept under the radar from getting caught. It feels amazing being 20 years old and even though I should be 40, I don't care at all. I have lived like a 20 year old for so long and I hope to do so forever. I am also seeing a girl who thinks I am 20 years old, and she doesn't know that I haven't celebrated my birthday for the last 20 years and that's why I haven't aged. If she finds out she will surely be disgusted by me and tell the authorities. My best friend is another 20 year old guy who should be 60 years old, he hasn't celebrated his birthday for 40 years. We have both been living the life of a 20 year old for so long. I love it I really do. I live in a house full of other people who are in their early 20s and late teens because they haven't celebrated their birthdays as well. Some of them should be at least 90-100 years old. Last month a guy from our house hold who was 25, but should actually be 95, he had been caught by the authorities. Know one knows how he got caught but our best guess is that he might have been dating someone who was 25, and then that person must have found out. I mean this guy has purposely missed celebrating his birthdays for 70 years and it's hard to cover that up. We all saw on online videos, that he was taken to a room and there was a cake with 95 candles on there. He was screaming, begging and shouting for everyone not to celebrate his birthday. Everyone in that room celebrated his birthday and he aged so quickly. For 70 years he had a bad diet because he stayed as a 25 year old, that bad diet caught up with him as he turned 95 and he had multiple health problems. It scared all of us and we knew that we had to escape and go find another place. I hate birthdays i truly do. I am going to stay as a 20 year old for as long as I can escape celebrating them.",

      "content": "When I was eight, I spent a lot of time in my family’s pig pen. We lived out in the countryside, and the animals were like weird, smelly siblings. I didn’t mind them—until the day one of them started staring at me. At first, I thought it was funny. This big pig, bigger than the rest, would just... watch me. Even when it was eating, its eyes would flick toward me, unblinking. Like it was sizing me up. “Dad,” I said one day, trying to laugh it off, “one of the pigs is staring at me.” He looked over and went quiet. I’ll never forget the way his brow furrowed. “That’s not normal,” he muttered, almost to himself. That night, he slaughtered the pig. No warning. Just did it. I asked him why, and he didn’t answer. He just roasted the meat and served it for dinner. Later, when I couldn’t sleep, I crept downstairs. My dad was still awake, staring at his beer with hollow eyes. He finally spoke. “Sometimes, when pigs get hungry enough, they’ll eat anything. Even a person. But that one… it didn’t look hungry. It looked curious.” He paused. “And if a pig keeps staring at you like that, son… it might not be wondering if it can eat you. It might be deciding when.”",

      "content": "It was just before noon. Their mother was busy rocking the newborn, humming softly, tired but peaceful. Unnoticed, her two daughters, four and two years old, slipped away, giggling down the hallway. They were supposed to play downstairs, but the new room upstairs was calling. It was almost done, just missing the doorknob. That didn’t matter. Their toys were in there. Their dresses. Their tiny kingdom. The older girl led the way, pushing the door shut behind them. Inside, sunbeams danced on freshly painted walls. They scattered toys, pulled dresses from drawers, and spun around in fits of laughter. But as they played, the younger girl paused. Something in the room... changed. She looked at the door. Just a hole where the knob should be. And through it, a flicker. A movement. She pointed, wide-eyed. Her sister glanced over. “What? Is someone out there?” She marched to the door, fearless. “Hello?” she called down the hallway. “Is someone there?” Silence. She turned back with a shrug. “No one. I guess they left.” The girls returned to playing. Until a sound was heard. A soft whisper of paper under the door. The younger girl gasped and pointed again. The older one picked up the page. It was a drawing. Crayon scribbles of them, playing together. But behind them... A black shape. A crooked silhouette. One yellow eye. Her sister opened the door again. “Hey! Who’s there?” she shouted. Still nothing. She shut the door slowly. “It’s okay,” she said. “They’re gone.” But the younger girl couldn’t settle. She kept glancing back. And then, she froze. Under the door, a finger appeared. Thin. Pale. Beckoning. She went to speak, but her breath caught. An eye, staring through the hole. A yellow, sickly eye. Bloodshot. It looked as if it was grinning without a mouth. She grabbed her sister’s sleeve and tugged hard. The older girl turned, annoyed. \"What now?\" Then she too observed it. “Is it back?” she asked, her voice quiet now. She ran to the door and flung it open. Again, nothing. But before returning, she saw it. Saw something. From the top of the stairs, a silhouette cast a shadow, like ink crawling on the wall. It moved. Closer. The older sister slammed the door and threw her weight against it. The younger one joined her, small hands pressed to the wood. They felt pressure. Like something pushing back. Something that wanted to be let in. Something that will be let in. The door shuddered. The girls turned and ran, hearts pounding, crashing into the far wall of the room. Fearful. They squeezed their eyes shut, not knowing what else they could do. And then... A hand gripped their shoulders. “Girls,” a voice said gently. “Didn’t I tell you not to come up here?” It was their mother. She looked tired. Smiling. “Come on, lunch is ready,” she said, leading them downstairs. They passed the dining room, plates already set, but their mother paused. “Girls, please wash your hands first,” she said with a smile. So the girls turned back, heading past the stairs toward the washroom. The older sister again led the way, thith the little one trailing behind her And as they passed, the little one felt it again. That pressure. That knowing. She looked up the stairs. And there.. It stood. Twisted. Watching. A shadowy figure. Its yellow eye bloodshot and grinning. And once again... That finger. Beckoning.",

      "content": "Before becoming a fisherman, I was a mechanic on the Atol de la Petite Moëlle, it is an island near Brittany, not very well known but which was home to a single village. I replaced a mechanic turned fisherman who would have disappeared into the mists. Mists is a pea puree that has been there since...always. no one, even the Mayor, knows the origins of the mist. and Since many people disappear inside, our Mayor prohibited entry, some tried to ignore this rule... but in any case, we never saw them again. Not so long ago, a one-eyed sailor with a patched head came so that I could sell him an engine for his ship, which had been... more or less \"crunched\" in two... I told him that he would have to change boats but he didn't listen to me and took my best engine, even though he clearly knew that the engine on the rest of the boat would only last a few minutes, he considered it his baby and couldn't bring himself to abandon his boat. of course I wanted to ask him where he had gone and why his ship had been damaged... but he was in an indescribable trans, his last open eye seemed to reflect the cosmic infinity and visions of terror were mixed in his eyes. Even from the inhabitants of the village I cannot get any information: no one had seen or even heard him. I was the only one who saw it. The next day I decided to become a fisherman because my thirst for knowledge about this guy was sickening. My very dear colleagues welcomed me very warmly, and even as a rival in a certain way. I was the happy owner of \"ourouboros\", I don't know what it means but it could be Greek or Egyptian. After a few days, while my fishing companions slept in their boat in the port, I could not bring myself not to go into this mist. It was then that around midnight I left the port towards this grayish mass of smoke. Each maneuver had to be carefully planned so as not to hit a rock and each breath of air was more and more putrid, then, after several minutes in the mist, I saw a mountain of corpses several meters high, each member that made up the mound looked like a shapeless mass that had been digesting for days! Nightmarish visions invaded my mind and for a time I was transported into a vortex of suffering. but I was suddenly awakened by a crash at the rear of my ship! Panicked, I pressed the button and rushed straight ahead without looking back. Once back at the port around 3am, I saw that the back of what I consider to be the apple of my eye was destroyed! I sewed up my damaged coat and the next day, I went to buy an engine from the new mechanic, he told me to change ships but for my revenge trip, I wanted to destroy this mound of horror hidden in the mists with my faithful ship called...anyway, just a few minutes before the engine disconnected from my ship would be enough for me to complete this mission and the nuisances on the boat in my path are so stupid that they didn't see me. And I'm writing this \"page\" of myself to you so that if I never return from my mission, at least I will have destroyed this curse! I don't have time to reread it, so I'll let you deal with the mistakes I made because of my gouged out eye. But tell me, have you ever fished in the mist?",

      "content": "I had recently got Undertale for the Nintendo Switch. I bought it from some shady guy in an alleyway, but I didn't think anything of it. When I booted up the game, everything seemed normal at first, that is until I met Sans. His eyes were fully black, with a viscous black substance dripping down them, and he didn't tell any of his usual jokes. \"Hey there...\" His voice was different, thick with an unsettling echo that made the words feel distanced from reality. It lacked the playful tone I had come to expect, and a chill crept up my spine as I stared at the grotesque display on the screen. The usual whimsical background music was gone, replaced with a low, menacing hum that seemed to pulse in rhythm with my heartbeat. “Wanna have a little fun?” he continued, his grin never faltering, but it felt wrong, predatory. As I instinctively pressed the button to respond, I expected the usual options: Fight, Act, Item, or Mercy. Instead, there was just one: “Play.” With no other choice, I selected it. The screen darkened and a series of distorted sounds flooded my ears. Images flickered in and out—brief flashes of the fallen characters, their expressions twisted in terror. I recognized them—Papyrus, Undyne, Alphys—all distorted in a grotesque mishmash of horror and despair. Then, without warning, the screen exploded with a burst of static, and I found myself back in front of Sans. “Oops,” he said, his grin widening unnaturally. \"Looks like you weren't supposed to see that.\" “What was that?” I asked, my heart racing. “They say ignorance is bliss, kid. But aren’t you curious about what happens next?” He winked, and I felt a strange pull, a weight of compulsion to keep playing. The urge was like a whisper against the back of my mind, persistent and insistent. Reluctantly, I pressed on, navigating through areas I recognized but twisted beyond reason. The Ruins felt cavernous and bleak, echoing with the cries of long-gone monsters. Each encounter ended in a flash of violence, blood splattering across the screen in a grotesque parody of the original game. Violence I had never chosen, as if the game itself was controlling everything I did, forcing me into actions that turned my stomach. Trembling, I took a breath and pressed on, desperate to reach the next save point. I wanted to escape—but every effort led me deeper into this dark abyss. Each time I faced a familiar character, they no longer spoke. They only stared with hollow eyes, their mouths opening in a silent scream before dissolving into ashes that filled the air with an acrid scent. And then there was another encounter with Sans. This time, however, he wasn’t just standing there. He was fully animated, moving as if the game was glitching, breaking the fourth wall. “What’s wrong, kid? Lost?” he taunted, his voice now slithering like a snake. “Stop this!” I shouted at the screen, feeling silly but overwhelmed by his presence. The game didn’t respond; it pressed on, driving itself into darker territory. I could feel my fingers trembling on the controller, powerless against an unseen force. Suddenly, text abruptly cut across the screen: \"Let’s play hide and seek.\" I could hear his laughter, echoing as if it were coming from all around me, not just from the speaker, but from the very walls of my room. “I’ll find you,” he said, and in that moment, I knew it was more than a game. It felt as though he was literally searching for me, slipping through the cracks of the screen and into my reality. Panic washed over me. I dashed to power off the console, but it wouldn’t respond. The screen flickered, revealing grisly images of my own reflection, twisted and warped, with shadows looming in the corners of my room. Then it hit me—a realization stronger than fear. The guy from the alley had sold me something more than a game. What if that ‘shady deal’ had opened a door I couldn’t close? What if I wasn’t just playing Undertale anymore? What if the game wanted to play me? As I trembled with dread, I could hear the sound of footsteps echoing around my room. They were slow and deliberate, a mocking rhythm that matched the thumping in my chest. The air thickened with a sudden chill, and I turned slowly, the dark corners of my room stretching like the depths of the Ruins themselves. And in the shadows, those black, soulless eyes stared back at me, glistening with oil and malice, just like Sans. “Ready or not…” I knew then that the game had truly just begun.",

Then as I showed her my painting of a house she started to smile and then she put it in the bin. I couldn't believe how evil she could be. Then she just walked off and I was so distraught over it. I put a lot of effort into that painting of a house. Then I decided to paint a picture of a tree and I put so much effort into painting that tree. Then when I showed my mother my painting of a tree, she smiled and told me that I am an amazing painter. Then she threw it in the bin and I couldn't believe how evil she could be. I mean I put so much effort into that painting and all my mother does is put it in the bin. I don't know what I could do to make her happy and I am doing my best. Then when I made another painting of a sky, I thought that she will enjoy it, but really she just put it in the bin after saying how amazing it is. Then when I got good grades and I was really shocked at getting good grades, I thought that my mother will really be happy. Then when I got home, I became realistic and knew that she would just throw it in the bin. So I threw my grades in the bin in my room, and when my mother saw that I had put my grades in the bin, she couldn't believe the grades that I had gotten. She was so proud of me and hugged me. Then she threw it in the bin in the kitchen. Then I noticed that she throws away all of my achievements in the bin that is in the kitchen. She never puts anything else in the bin in the kitchen apart from my achievements. I started to really wonder why she does this, and it's when my father walked out on us all those years ago, that's when she started throwing my achievements in the bin that's in the kitchen. It really hurt me when she took my grades out of my bin in my room, and put it in the bin that's in the kitchen. That's just straight up evil and when I went to the bin in the kitchen, when I looked inside the bin in the kitchen, I saw my father that was all cut up into pieces but was still alive. He had all my paintings and achievements and he said to me \"well done son for getting good grades\" in the most croakiest voice My mother then explained to me that she murdered my father and cut him up into pieces for cheating on her.",

      "content": "The best way to tell how good a pilot is, I'd the way they crash. I remember when I was on one plane and then suddenly the plane went down. It crashed at some random place and every plane equipment was all over the place. It was clear to me that the pilot wasn't a good pilot because the way the plane had crashed, it had no control or grace to it. It was like a mental break down or drunk driver driving on the high way. This plane crash was all over the place and it had no clear target, it was a fail of a crash. Then suddenly I was in another place and I was some 70 year old guy shouting at the maintenance guy for fixing some doors. I am a 70 year old concierge now and the first group of doors, residents keep going through it and I have to let them through and the buzzer keeps going off. When the doors broke people could get through without me needing to open it, plus no one needed to buzz me and so it was peaceful and silent. Then after a couple of months, an engineer fixed it and so now I had to let everyone in and out, and the buzzing sound when the pressed the button, it was hell. I yelled at the engineer for fixing the doors. Then I was back in another plane, and everything was going nicely until the plane started going down. The way it was going down there was a target and so much control. There was some grace and courage to this fall and I could tell that the pilot was a good pilot. When the plane crashed there was a message to the crash. Unlike the other crash there was no hidden message or agenda to it, it was just a crash. The pilot knew what he was doing. Then I was a 70 year old concierge again and I was shouting at the engineer for fixing the toilet that kept on flushing. I liked how it had kept on flushing, because everyone who did a toilet in that toilet, it never stank up the bathroom as the toilet was constantly flushing. Yes water bill would be high but no extreme smells in the bathroom. I hated that engineer. I told the engineer that not all things need to be fixed. Like the car park gate, if it is open all the time, then cars could come and go. If it gets fixed then people would have to buzz and constantly need me. Then I was in another plane that was falling and there was no grace to it, or any pride or courage. It was just a plane falling and clearly this pilot was a bad one.",

      "title": "I'm A Fire Tower Watchman In Appalachia. Something Strange Is Happening Around My Tower.",
      "content": "I wont give my name for the sake of my job, but I will say I work in Appalachia. It was around June so it was warm and super humid outside. I had been in the lookout for about a week already and all I really did was check in and keep watch. It was about eleven PM and I called the crew chief to clock in my last check in for the day. He asked me if I ran into anything today and I just told him no. He copied and I walked back to my desk to dive back into the book I had been reading. I sat down for not even five minutes when a bright flash engulfed the north side of my towers windows. I nearly fell out of my chair trying to jump to my feet. I stood there in disbelief not knowing if it was some rouge lightning bolt or a UFO. I looked out the windows and stared into pure darkness. I could see nothing but the dark forest silhouette underneath the bright moon light. I looked for about Three minutes and saw nothing. I got onto the radio and made a call to Three Tower who was my closest neighbor. He picked up the radio and asked what was wrong. I asked if he had seen a bright flash in the north and he said he hadn't. I told him it must have been my imagination and he ten foured me on. Just as I sat the radio down I began to hear what sounded like a low humming noise. I opened the door and waked out into the moon light. The humming stopped as soon as I steeped outside. I walked around the perimeter of the tower and found nothing. I made my way back to the door scratching my head at what was happening. I went inside and locked the door preparing myself for sleep. I kicked off my boots and hopped into bed melting my day away. When I woke up the next morning I made my coffee and began my morning readings. I opened the tower door and stepped out into the beautiful morning. The fog was thick and I couldn't really see anything on the ground. I leaned against the railing and sipped my coffee as I took in the morning air. I spun around to go back inside and that's when I noticed it. A hand print on the door window. The only reason I noticed it is because it was almost printed into the door with what looked like black soot, almost like charcoal or something like that. I panicked a little and radioed Three Tower again and let him know about my finding. He said I must have done it by accident or it was there and I didn't notice it before. I reluctantly agreed with him and signed out. The day went by as usual with nothing going on at all. I radioed in my last check in at eleven PM and I waited. My plan tonight was to pretend to be asleep and see if I could catch anything. I sat up for a couple hours fighting the urge to drift off into dream land when all of a sudden thunderous footsteps began to sprint up the stairs leading up my tower. I rolled off of my bed and crawled under the bed. The sprinting continued until they were one flight of stairs away from the top of the tower. The sprinting slowed to an almost predator like creeping, Footsteps to heavy to hide. They finally hit the top of the stairs but to my amazement, nothing was there. The creeping continued along the outside of the tower until they reached the door. My heart was in my throat and I was almost certain I was dying. Nothing happened after that. A deafening silence broke throughout the forest. Not a cricket was fiddling nor a owl was hooting. I Fell asleep under my bed and woke up to another beautiful morning. I tried to tell my boss but they simply don't believe me, blaming the solitude on my \"nightmares\". So I bring this to reddit in an attempt to see if this has happened to anyone else or if maybe someone has an explanation. I’ll update everyone later.",

      "title": "There’s a woman on the balcony next to ours. I don’t know if she’s alive",
      "content": "I don’t usually post, but this has been weighing on me for a while now, and I can’t stop thinking about it. My wife says I should just forget about it, but I can’t shake the feeling that something’s off. Not just strange — wrong. I don’t know what I’m hoping for. Maybe just a second opinion. Maybe someone’s seen something like this before. My wife and I moved into a small apartment in Munich in early 2023. It’s a quiet place — not too far from the center, a little old, but it has a balcony, which we’ve come to love. We go out there every evening to smoke and unwind, no matter how cold it gets. The view’s nothing special, just other buildings and balconies, but one of those balconies has been bothering me since the day we moved in. To the left of our balcony — almost perpendicular, forming an L shape — is another balcony. It belongs to a unit where an old woman lives. We’ve seen her a few times, which is how we know it’s just her — we’ve never seen anyone else there. But here’s the strange part: Her apartment is always dark. Always. I mean pitch black. We’ve lived here over a year now. We’re on the balcony almost every evening, and I have never seen a light on in her apartment. Not once. Not a flicker. Not a hallway light, not a reading lamp, nothing. Day or night, rain or shine — her windows are like black mirrors. We see her sometimes. Some weeks, we don’t see her at all. Then she’ll appear on her balcony again like nothing happened. She never really looks at us. Sometimes she responds to a “hello” with a faint, almost... off-smile. Most of the time she doesn’t react at all. But what really gets me is what she does when she’s out there. She leans over her railing — far, dangerously far — and cranes her neck to look at the balcony next to hers. Not at the sky, not down into the street — the balcony itself. She bends out so far it looks like she’s about to tip over. Sometimes she stays like that for minutes. Not moving. Just staring. I’ve seen her do it multiple times now. It’s always the same: the angle, the stillness, the way her hands grip the rail too tight. My wife swears she’s seen her standing close to our balcony door once, late at night. Just standing there. Not knocking. Not moving. Not even looking in. Just... there. We didn’t hear her come out. We didn’t hear her go back in. She was just there one moment and gone the next. We’ve asked the landlord about her. He just shrugged and said, “She’s been there a long time. Quiet. Keeps to herself.” I’ve looked at that balcony every night since. Some nights, nothing. Other nights, she’s there again — back in her usual position, leaning over just a bit too far, staring into someone else’s world like she’s trying to remember it. I don’t know who she is. I don’t know if she’s even really... living there. But whatever she is, I can’t shake the feeling that she’s not watching them. She’s watching us. And maybe she always has been. Let me know what you think. Am I losing it, or does this sound as weird to you as it feels to me?",

No engineer could pin point what was wrong or how to fix it, the world started to become desperate for WiFi. Society started to crumble fast and they had to go back to the old ways of doing things. People had to start being nice to each other and that was the worst thing that people could think of. Then one day as I walked past a man, he had some internet connection. He was over joyed as he had internet connection for a couple of minutes. Then when I went past other people, they too had internet connection for a couple of minutes. Then one guy clocked on that whenever I walk past someone, they always seem to have internet connection. Then as more people started to notice that whenever they go near me, they are able to get internet connection. I started to get loads of people just wanting to come near me so that they could go online, they needed to go online. The whole world wanted to go online, and then i started to get a gathering that were always following me so that they could get onto the internet. I then made it onto the headline news as the WiFi guy and more people started to flock to me. I then got some business guys who through me, started to charge people wanting to come close to me. I became famous and no one knows why my body was the only thing giving off WiFi. At first it was great getting all of the attention and fame, but then I just wanted to be alone. I wanted my own privacy and then I got kidnapped. I got a kidnapped by a guy who had a porn addiction and he locked me in a prison, so that he would get WiFi all the time. I was found when people started to get WiFi when they came close to this guys house. So they knew that I was in there and that was a horrifying experience. I had other kidnapping attempts and some even killed others so that they could get close to me and have some WiFi. I remember once when a whole gathering started go fight each other, when they all needed more WiFi. I don't want to be the WiFi man anymore.",

What she did remember was slamming the door and storming off into the night, sneakers crunching down the gravel path that led to the forest’s edge. Lanterns lit the main road in soft amber, guiding her deeper into the woods. She didn’t want to go to town—she didn’t want to see anyone. Her few friends were more like classmates. The forest, at least, wouldn’t ask questions. But after a mile or so, the lanterns began to flicker… then fade. One by one, the lights winked out, until only the moon lit her path. And then she saw it: an old graveyard, half-swallowed by trees and fog. Weather-worn headstones tilted like teeth. She stepped inside. That’s when she heard the voices. Children emerged from the mist—five or six of them, barefoot and pale, dressed in clothes that didn’t belong to any decade she knew. One clutched a limp doll. Another chewed on the end of a sleeve. Their faces looked worried. “You shouldn’t be here,” a boy said, eyes wide with worry. “It’s coming.” “What is?” Sadie asked, her breath catching in the cold air. They pointed—to a mound of disturbed earth near the edge of the graveyard. A small burrow. Just big enough for her. “Please,” a girl whispered. “If it sees you, you won’t be you anymore.” Fear settled deep in Sadie’s ribs. She hesitated—then climbed in. The soil was damp, the walls pressing close. She turned to ask what to do next—but they were already shoveling dirt back in. With their hands. “Wait—stop! What are you doing?!” she cried, clawing at the sides. Their faces shifted. Smiles bloomed. Giggles started. “You’ll be safe here,” one said sweetly. Then came the chant. “You’ll be safe here. You’ll be safe here. You’ll be safe here…” Sadie thrashed, but it was too late. Dirt filled her mouth. Her world narrowed to shadows and voices. Just before everything went black, one soft voice whispered: “We’ve always wanted a big sister.” You can find daily bedtime stories like this on @Ghostlygenerations (IG).

Then my diamonds were gone. So I started recording my game every evening so after that night I can see who or what removed my items. So I went to sleep. In the Morning I started to watch my recordings. There was something... Something that wrote \"3 People\" and \"Your fault\" in the chat. I didn't mind and watched some TV. There were news and one of them said \"3 Days ago a drunken driver crashed into a Car with a Family of 3 People\". I started my PC again and played Minecraft. But this time I went to my house and it was on flames. This time I freaked out but then I saw a sign where was written \"You destroyed my life so I destroy your house\" I didn't know what to do. Why is that thing say that I destroyed his life? I really don't know. Yesterday the Police knocked on my door and arrested me. They say that I had a crash a few days ago because I was drunk. 3 People died in this accident. What the hell is going on? Okay.. maybe I have some drink problems but I never would drink and drive. Today I'm a bit nervous to start my PC because the things are worse. Every time I start my PC the Editor opens and there is written \"YOUR FAULT\" and \"3 HUMANS\". I don't know what to do. I think the best idea is to take my own life. I only write this because I don't think that this is true. The entire story of me killing 3 People by an accident is not true and I know it. Edit: Thats my first creepypasta ever so don't think that this is going to be good :D",

Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.",
